% Data Characteristics
% 
%    The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at each web page
%    and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100 pages per
%    domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn user
%    profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
% Data Format
% 
%    Each subject is in a seperate directory. Within each directory, there
%    is an file named "index". The index contains information on the other
%    files. Each entry is a line of the form:
%  file-name  |  rating  |  url  |  date-rated  |  title
% 
%    where file-name is the name of a file (usually an integer), rating is
%    hot, medium, or cold. There are so few medium's that mediums are
%    usually merged with cold in experiments.
% 
%    The other fields aren't used in learning, but they are collected by
%    the interface for other purposes. They are the url of the html source,
%    the date rated and the title of the web oage.

% Problem Description
% 
%    The problem is to predict user ratings for web pages (within a subject
%    category). The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at
%    each web page and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100
%    pages per domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn
%    user profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
%    The accuracy of predicting ratings is reported in early publications.
%    Later publications used the precision at top N or the F-measure.
% 
% Results
% 
%    The initially study compared traditional meachine learning methods
%    with IR methods. A variety of learning algorithms worked acceptably,
%    including naive bayes, nearest neighbor, and Rocchio's method

Active in the San Francisco music scene since the post-punk explosion of the mid-80\'s, both Rayburn and bassist Sally Engelfried comprised two-thirds of the folk-punk band Yo, who delighted audiences with their three independently released albums on Deadbeat and Enigma Records. Band member Christine Wall brings to the band sweet-tinged vocal harmonies which made her contributions to the last two Chris Isaak records (including the hit \"Wicked Game\") so memorable. Violinist John Tenney is a veteran of stage and record whose solid musicianship has been appreciated by the likes of XTC, Van Morrison, and Frank Sinatra, with whom he has played. Together El Sob\'s quirky mix of stark yet dense lyrics and sweet and brooding music comprises the unique sounds you will hear on this tape.

Combined with the unusual instrumention--squeaky pork chop, gargling, and animal noises--this discourse makes \"Skin a Cat\" one of El Sob\'s most popular live tunes. LYRICS Hey diddle the cat and the fiddle Stick it out on Chicken Little Lucy in the Sky and the Cat in the Hat Don\'t waste your time on things like that I ain\'t nothing like you I ain\'t nothing like you There\'s more than one way to skin a cat I live till I die and I can\'t come back Koo koo ca choo and the joke\'s on you Laugh in their face \'cause the things they do I ain\'t nothing like you I ain\'t nothing like you Do it like me, do it like me Do it like me It\'s better like me! Up in the sky with a thousand eyes Everyone\'s looking for love at first sight There\'s more than one way to skin a cat I live till I die and I can\'t come back I ain\'t nothing like you I ain\'t nothing like you Be more like me, be more like me Be more like me It\'s better like me! OTHER INFO (because we don\'t have any press reviews!) El Sob...and Stuff Folk-roots rockers El Sob coined the term \"Stuff Band\" to describe themselves because \"we\'re not afraid to play anything that might come our way while shopping at Thrift Town,\" says Christine Wall, who has been known to balance a cowbell, a glass of water for gargling, and a dog toy during the course of one song. \"I used to play a regular electric bass,\" adds Sally Engelfried, \"but I found it too limiting, so in searching for the right sound I had one made for me.\" The resulting one-of-a-kind instrument is striking in its piano-like resonance. \"I\'m devoted to El Sob because this is the only band that lets me shake my tookus in public,\" comments John Tenney, who sometimes takes a turn at tambourine and kazoo, in addition to his specialties of violin and mandolin. Bruce Rayburn, whose stuff most often comes from down-and-out cousins, has been known to write songs about stuff and his cousins. \"I got Christine\'s dumbek for her from an old girlfriend who owed me,\" says Rayburn gleefully. MERCHANDISE DESCRIPTION YOU\'VE HEARD ABOUT THE STUFF, NOW HEAR THE STUFF!

The human eye looks for color and excitement, and the human body responds to tension and energy. Lead Pipe Cinch demands these reactions! Not even a year-old, this Seattle band quickly developed a sound and energy all it\'s own. \"Big Rock!\" says Abe Beason from 90.3 KCMU in Seattle. After a successful first demo which garnered college radio play throughout the Northwest, Lead Cinch Pipe has recorded 3 new songs that show the maturity and growth of the band. Winnipeg, Gun, and I Suspend, are new pieces which feature the diversity and excitement of their music. Lead Pipe Cinch has played with national acts, headlined it\'s own shows in Vancouver, B.C., Seattle, Ellensburg, Spokane, and performed live on Seattle college radio station KCMU. Soon to be exposed internationally through the Internet, Lead Pipe Cinch is creating a buzz throughout the underground. Hooky, melodic and heavy are operative adjectives for LPC\'s songs, which complement their assaulting, in your face live performance. Excited and confident from overwhelmingly positive audience response, Lead Pipe Cinch gathers steam in their ardent quest to Rock The Nation!!!

And, it\'s where love and innocence are found, and lost, and found again, someplace between a margarita and a forgotten Elvis movie. [9][JL Porter: album cover] Porter\'s debut CD, Viva La Revolucion! (on independent label Permanent Records Del Mar), covers all these bases and more. The 12 songs, performed by Porter (on his trusty Vox Wildcat guitar) and drummer Brendan Kremer, feature stripped-down arrangements and a light, rockabilly feel. This disc is produced by Porter and fellow San Diego singer/songwriter \"Famous\" Steve Denyes. Viva La Revolucion! has been lauded not only by San Diego\'s music press, but also in the pages of Nashville-based national magazine Performing Songrwriter. Porter is a regular performer at San Diego\'s coffeehouses and bars. Contact Porter via Permanent Records Del Mar\'s voice-mail at 619/454-1627; or by email at jlporter@cts.com.

As a white male, he watched his fellow Anglo-Americans create and perpetuate racist, prejudiced and sexist ideals. With his self-produced debut of \"Organic Hard-Core\" Rap he is out to unsettle the status quo and give them a dose, from one of \"their own\", of something that they have been deaf to for far too long... the TRUTH. [11][the man himself] [12][record label log] Adam Bomb\'s rhymes defend individual freedom, attack authority and define true liberty which, to him, is more than just privileges for the advantaged few. His music throbs and grooves with funky samples, rock and funk inspired guitar tracks, keyboards, and live horns. \"Government, religion, and social standing are not excuses for racism, sexism, oppression and censorship by the powers that be,\" Adam Bomb says. \"The Constitution was a great document, in theory, but its ideals have not been afforded, to this day, to all men and womyn equally. It has never been anything more than a fairy tale to many of the people who in large part built this country, but have to ask permission to share the dream.\" His tracks confront everything from racist attitudes of the powers that be, to sexism and the failing two-party political system. \"Stand On Up\", inspired by a Malcolm X speech warn all races that things haven\'t changed enough to relax on any level, and that action like that of the 60\'s Civil Rights movement is still a must: \'Cause if you\'re sittin\' then you\'re just a sittin\' duck Lettin\' those who choose, bombs instead of schools Still vote for the sucker, if ya vote at all fool In \"Peacemaker, Soulshaker\", Adam Bomb serves up other ideologies he disdains -- misogyny, organized religion, bigotry and violence among all races of people who should be fighting the system rather than smoking dope, drinking \"40\'s\" and killing each other. \"The System\" calls for an end to the two-party system which as Adam Bomb sees it is a farce. \"Although the two groups make a lot of noise espousing different points of view, they are essentially the same. They have their own best interests in mind and the true needs of the masses are not even an issue\". My vision Destroy the institution With an urge ta purge suckers that are usin\' up the masses Mutha fuckin\' facists, I won\'t be passive Better believe I\'m down for somethin\' drastic... Enough of this evil Politicians gonna keep ya in submission till ya feeble \"Everybody Get-A-Gun\" takes a sarcastic swipe at those in our society who are obsessed with firearms. Mother don\'t cry, he only thought he was protecting you Not expecting to Take out his own son, with a cap from his own gun The same gatt we used ta shoot for fun... The Second Amendment Nothin\' more than a remnant of our past The Second Amendment Propaganda from a Klansmen in my path By attacking long since established views, values and philosophies, Adam Bomb is prepared for criticism from middle America. He is also prepared for the Hip-Hop and Rap communities to come at him as well by virtue of the fact that his skin is white. \"I\'ve seen it happen, and quite frankly in many cases, people got what they deserved. I feel my music is different. My lyrics are relevant and I am not wasting people\'s time to fill my pockets. It\'s people\'s minds I hope to help set free\". Realizing his passion for expressing himself through music at an early age, Adam Bomb formed a band with his brother when he was barely out of elementary school. He went from high school to study sound design at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. It was during his college years that Adam Bomb discovered a powerful from of expression that spoke to him and the ideals that he believed in vehemently. He walked in to a record store one day and knew that in Rap he had found his niche. \"I heard Public Enemy in a local store, and their message and delivery inspired me to change my outlook on music\", Adam Bomb recalls. \"Chuck D\'s lyrics were intelligent, deep and pertinent.\" Chuck D, KRS-1 and Ice Cube became his strongest Rap influences. Adam Bomb\'s first project was producing a young rapper named Stud B. As Adam Bomb learned about rap as an art form, he began producing tracks for both himself and Stud B, that were both political and original. Songs like \"Earth to the White Man\" and \"Proof is in the Pudding\", which was a reaction to the Rodney King beating, were results of the pairs collaboration. Now a resident of Los Angeles, Adam Bomb continues to grow and evolve as an artist. He keeps his ears, heart and mind open for innovative sounds and ideas and persists at expressing the truth, which he hopes will force those \"in charge\" to finally own up to their wrongs and relinquish the power to those who should have had it all along. _________________________________________________________________ Quotes and Other Stuff Exploding across the Net, North America, and Europe! I got your tape in the post this morning. i listened to all of it before coming in to work. it really is great, \'organic hardcore\' just about describes it for me. a couple of the tracks have got double vocals on them - are they both you? - one at a higher pitch than the other, this sounds a lot like early PE, I\'m thinking of \'megablast\' especially. I also picked up house of pain & ratm (your voice - in places) styles, yet not derivative, more expansive. I\'ll be playing your tape on my show tonight.

ISIKOJAM was formed while Kirk Casey, Soul Maah, and Maanas Itene were backing various South African and reggae artists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Kirk brought keyboardist Jonathan Ridpath to the group, and after one night of playing that was it! \"It felt as though we had been playing together for years.\" ISIKOJAM combines many styles of music and fuses them together to produce music that is very groove oriented with distinct melodies. BASS: Simon (Soul) Maah from Cameroon played with EKAMBI Brilliant and Manu Dibango, The Soul Makossa Man. Soul left Cameroon for Nigeria to play with Jerry Cooper. He then embarked on a thirteen year recording and producing career that took him to such world class studios as EMI, DECCA, Phonodisk, RecordDisk, Satellite, and TABANSI. After touring with Sonny Okusons for five years, Soul came to the United States looking for new challenges. Residing in the East Bay, Soul plays for many international and local artists that make their way through the Bay Area. GUITARS: Kirk Casey was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a young teenager his band opened shows for The Grateful Dead, Santana, and The Sons Of Champlin. Studying composition in college, Kirk then continued with Cuban Classical guitar. Kirk\'s interest in world music and jazz lead him to study music from many countries of the world. He then studied with Miles Davis guitarist Dave Cramer. Currently, Kirk can be heard on many national television commercials for such Fortune 500 companies as Alamo Car rental, Toyota, GMC trucks, Buick,Yamaha motorcycles, and the NBA. Kirk also tours internationally with Jamaican artists Della Grant and The Twinkle Brothers. DRUMS: Maanas Itene hails from Nigeria, West Africa. It took Maanas three years to get to the United States to seek his fortune as a respected musician. Upon arrival to the United States the tour previously scheduled for the band was canceled. Maanas found himself without work and stranded. He made his way to the Bay Area, and now tours with KOTOJA, West African High Life Band, and Inka Inka. Groups that Maanas has formerly played with in Nigeria include Liberty Loverboy, Victor Suuku, Isaac Black, King Walla Man, and Mandators. KEYBOARDS: Jonathan Ridpath has been playing for over thirty years. He studied at the Berklee School of Music and the New England Conservatory. After his schooling, Jonathan then toured along the East Coast, and has played at Tanglewood on several occasions. Jonathan moved to San Francisco in 1976 and began teaching classical piano. Jonathan recently released a solo EP, titled Reflections. For information about ISIKOJAM please contact: ISIKOJAM MUSIC P.O.

Then the lyrics are repeated with AWESOME music. We repeat the Spanish and English words and phrases up to 4 times for the longer phrases. YOU DO NOT GET BORED because your mind fixates on the music and you pick up the Spanish the way you pick up words to your favorite song. YOUR MIND BECOMES BILINGUAL. The Result You may be in a Spanish Restaurant and hear \"Disculpame.\" Right away you think \"Excuse Me.\" It becomes automatic. You actually think in English but speak in Spanish (in the beginning.) History of RAPANESE Rapanese was created by a Canadian, ex-disc jockey, school teacher, Mike D\'Amours. He started using Rapanese in his classroom of 25 students in 1989.

All instruments and vocals performed, produced, and composed by Pattrex. Copyright 1995 Pattrex. Email at \"pattrex@npixi.com\". Pattrex performs with a 4 piece backing band occasionally. They are loud (like a jet taking off at a distance of 10 feet), so bring ear protection when you see them. Yes, Pattrex is a vegetarian but that doesn\'t mean he is a \"nice mellow kind of guy\". Hemorrhaging at concerts is not a fun thing. Protect your ears. Always. The idea behind Pattrex is to create exciting experiences utilizing available technology. Pattrex is part of an emerging convergence of these tools. The song you\'ll be listening to is a midtempo type pop thing. Kinda sounds like a cross between Smashing Pumpkins and Peter Gabriel. And then some. The music is real. If you like what you hear and want to hear more please send check or money order of $9.00 plus $2.00 shipping and handling to: [10]Empty Street Productions 931 Monroe Drive STE 102-183 Atlanta, GA 30308 For a 4 song cassette tape and some propaganda mailings. If you ask, we\'ll even enclose a Macintosh Floppy Disk Demo (requires a color capable Mac and at least a 13\" screen). Allow 6 weeks for delivery (A&R reps get free tape if they promise to listen to the damn thing, send email). There are several Pattrex Web Sites available throughout the universe. Here\'s a popular one: [11]http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html You will soon be able to electronically order a Pattrex CD EP over various BBS\'s. This will really expedite things, \'cause you\'ll be able to use your credit card and get the CD mailed to you overnight. Wow. Again, send email if you are interested in that. This should be up and running by May 1995 Most of what you are hearing was created and recorded digitally. The studio this was recorded in is a tiny back room at Empty Street in Atlanta, GA. Most of the studio lives in a Macintosh IIvx computer with a 1.2 GB Hard Disk and Opcode\'s StudioVision sequencer/digital recorder. Pattrex used inexpensive and readily-available hardware and software for this effort. Mackie mixers were used, and Alesis effects devices. I recommend these brands pretty highly. Tannoy speakers (PBM 6.5s). Also, a basic Tascam 488 cassette 8 track was used to slave in some additional tracks. Pretty simple stuff, actually. The only semi-expensive element was an AKG C414 microphone I rented for a day for $10 from Private Studios in Champaign Illinois (thanks Jon! PS: call up and harass Jon at (217) 367-3530). Oh, yeah- a cool 12 string electric guitar was borrowed from CV LLoyde\'s in Champaign (call (217) 352-7031 to harass Gary and CV and order stuff). But that\'s not all... Pattrex has several multimedia demos available on-line through the internet and on services such as America Online and Compuserve. One of these, the first Macintosh-created music industry promo clip available on the Internet, is called \"pats music video\" and is available via anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu under directory /info-mac/grf/qt. Pattrex also has appeared on the Internet \"musenet\" 1992 compilation CD with the song \"There\'s Love Here Today\", and on the 10th AMUG CDROM compilation BBS-In-A-Box (available through the Arizona Macintosh Users Group). Pattrex is a founding member of the renegade multimedia group \"NPiX InterActive\", and creates freelance multimedia for the entertainment industry in his spare time. Pattrex is a member of IICS (International Interactive Computing Society), ASCAP, and an Apple Associate Developer and MultiMedia Program member. Pattrex is also part of [12]NPiX Interactive. You *might* be able to reach Pattrex at (404) US-FOLKS. Maybe. That machine is pretty flaky, though. Email is best. Or voice mail us at (404) 892-1971. Critics say: \"Hot, Hot, Hot. It sure is f*cking hot out today, why the hell don\'t you get air conditioning huh?\" - Gary Strater of the band StarCastle formerly on Epic Records (check out StarCastle\'s upcoming album!) \"I hope you know your rent is past due.

Box 170331 San Francisco, California 94117 USA fax: (415) 885.6091 e-mail: dj.miscreant@sfnet.com Legal: Jeff LaFave, Esq. Thorsnes, Bartolotta, McGuire & Padilla Fifth Ave. Financial Center, 11th Floor 2550 Fifth Avenue San Diego, CA 92103 Excerpted from an interview with Ms. Karen Eliot, editor of BULLET TRAIN: When and where did the band coalesce? Hungry Ghost began in 1937 near Brussels, but the band really began creating in earnest about a year ago. Our home base is San Francisco, but Ulbrecht recently moved to Moscow for a two-year stint posing as an American attorney. Bhopal coordinates his efforts from San Diego, California because he likes to surf with the sharks. How would you describe the music? We consider our stuff pretty diverse. We strive to create ambient soundscapes and sound collages with an ethnic-industrial twist. How does the band create the music? We do a lot of free forming. Most times we start with sound clips taken from the urban environment that surrounds us and then mush \'em together with guitars, percussion, samplers and synthesizers. A lot of times we do long, improvisational jam sessions and take out short clips for further manipulation. Other times, we have a particular mood or idea in mind and create songs around this concept with whatever sound is handy at the time. We work well together; everyone has a finger in the creation of a song. Where do you do your creating? We have our own studio, called DS2 (Death of a Supermodel or 2) here in San Francisco. It\'s clean and warm and has everything we require. The digital age has made us self-sufficient in our creative efforts. Do you have any recordings available yet? We have two jukebox 45s floating around. One is a single with two cuts: \"Maimana Casque\" and \"Quechua Click.\" Recently, we cut a joint single with friends from Portland, Oregon. Our cut is called \"Miles.\" On the flip side is a band called Compost. Around August 1994, we\'ll be releasing our first CD, which is entitled \"Brownout at the Spectacle.\" These items are available through our label, Galivant Media in San Francisco. You can mail order all of it. Any other projects in the works? Yeah . . . We have some videos in the works. We\'ve been shooting a lot of Super 8mm film, which is a truly wonderful medium. Very grainy and great texture; quite a contrast to the sterility of most other formats. When a song gives us particular inspiration, we create some visual images to accompany it. We\'re planning on distributing the videos through Galivant Media, and we have plans to air the videos on OFFLINE, which is a public access program distributed on networks around the United States. We\'re working on a soundtrack for a public access film about graffiti art in subway tunnels. It\'s in the works... We\'re also working with multimedia artists who produce CD-ROMs. The group is called Cafe-E, and they\'re in New York. We provide them with \"content,\" as it\'s called in the venacular. Do you have any plans to tour? Not as yet, but we\'re not averse to live gigs. We want to wait until there is sufficient interest in our music before we venture forth from the comfortable confines of DS2. When we do decide to tour, we\'d like to start in Europe. That way we can tour and vacation at the same time. We feel no pressure though. Is there any political bent in the music? Just the usual smash the State stuff. We don\'t use lyrics as such, so the sound textures are more open to interpretation than the straight narrative stuff in most music. This drives some people crazy, but we expect each listener to interpret the soundscapes in their own way based on what they\'re thinking or feeling at the time. We definitely have our own political agendas, but they aren\'t essential to our musical agendas. ======= [12][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Hungry_Ghost/Hungry_Ghost.jpg 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Hungry_Ghost/mono-excerpt-Aboral.au 3. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Hungry_Ghost/mono-excerpt-Aboral.mp2 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Hungry_Ghost/mono-Aboral.mp2 5. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Hungry_Ghost/stereo-Aboral.mp2 6. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/AM_004.html#Hungry_Ghost 7. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/HC_004.html#Hungry_Ghost 8. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-ola-comment.pl?Hungry_Ghost 9. mailto:tjustman@galivant.com 10. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Hungry_Ghost/html/songs.html 11. file://localhost/iuma-bin/buy.pl?init=Hungry_Ghost 12. file://localhost/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',cold

After three independent releases on the Figurehead label, he felt that it was time to focus on writing lyrics and music that was a little more raw and a little less serious than what Braille Closet was doing. In early 1993, Bill started the Canned Corn label. The first release in Spring of 1993 was Redbug\'s \"Blue Light Special\" b/w \"Downtown\" 7-inch. The single received good airplay in a few markets and none in a lot. Redbug played a few shows with various members: drummer Brian Maguire (currently with Jacksonville\'s Dave Ronan and the Hootowls) and bassist Andrew Dalio (also of Disco Biscuit). Blair had been working on a solo project and was recruited to sing on the record and play bass on a mini-tour since Andrew\'s other band keeps him real busy. The session for the current album, \"No Muffins For Shadow!,\" started as a session for another 7-inch. Engineer Mark Ignoffo had worked with Smashing Pumpkins in their early days, and the band was impressed with a lot of the music coming out of his studio, Reel Time. Mark didn\'t know what to think of Redbug at first. The band didn\'t care. They just wanted to take advantage of his 20 hours for $500.00 special. Two of the songs on the album, \"Hush Puppy\" and \"Steely Cowsdell,\" were improvisational jams that ended up on the record. Also included on the C.D. are wacky versions of Deep Purple\'s \"Highway Star\" and Pearl Jam\'s \"Black.\" \"Blue Light Special\" and \"Downtown\" were remixed and included on the disc also. \"Astro-Manta-Ray\" is a tribute to one of the band\'s faves, Man or Astro-Man. The song \"Funky Nassau\" available here is a eulogy to our now defunct bowling league, Crush Crush Crush. Redbug\'s music was described in Minneapolis\' YOUR FLESH as \"proficient country-dork spoo.\" Charlotte\'s THE INDIE FILE described them as \"They Might Be Giants with some real talent.\" The bands influences range from The Outlaws and Buck Owens to the B-52\'s and X. They prefer not to be categorized, but if need be, call \'em cow-dork-punk.

Having performed various types of Music, he then began to record solo acoustic guitar pieces which were compiled for his first release \"Storytale\" in 1988. While searching for a new and unique medium, Jim began composing music for Doppelgitarre (a type of German harp guitar) in 1989. Having been introduced to engineer/producer Howard Toole in 1989, the two decided to co-produce an album. \"Music For Doppelgitarre\" was released in 1990. Jim performed in various places in Tennessee, then moved back to Charlotte in 1991. Since that time, Jim has been performing in various venues in the southeast, as well as composing instrumental music for the forthcoming release \"Pure White Monday\" and guitar/vocal music for his performances and future recordings. \"Music for Doppelgitarre\" is a collection of ten solo doppelgitarre pieces. The music is very melodic in structure, and intended to convey a sense of serenity, color, and warmth. As stated in a review by Guitar Player magazine, \"perfect for a morning cup of Java or an evening of quiet solitude.\" \"Pure White Monday\", however, is more diverse containing different musical styles including pieces for guitar, doppelgitarre, guitar synthesizer, and piano. Jim\'s vocal music is rather like \"introspective folk\", with lyrics to \"live by\" and both flowing and aggressive guitar phrases. To order \"Music for Doppelgitarre\" send $14.00 for CD or $9.00 for cassette plus $1.50 shipping to CIR, P.O. Box 12505, Charlotte, NC 28220. \"Pure White Monday\" is not yet released as Jim is looking for a record company with interest in marketing it. For bookings or industry information, call 704/344-1819 or e-mail jandrews@cybernetics.net. Songs included on IUMA \"Momentum\" from \"Music for Doppelgitarre\" The mood for this piece is described by its title. It contains intricate phrases with harp string melodies mixed with quick guitar picking. The melody, as always, is evident as it strikes the contemplative side of the listener. \"Serenity\" - a live guitar/vocal recording The title is somewhat ironic, as this is one of the more aggressive pieces. It represents a good example of the diversity found in one of Jim\'s performances. \"Doppelwerk\" from \"Pure White Monday\" This piece contains contrasting phrases from the doppelgitarre and piano. The movement continues a steady pace throughout the song, and the song was titled \"Doppelwerk\" as it sounds like a more melodic, acoustic version of a well known German techno band. ======= [10][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Andrews,_Jim/mono-excerpt-Doppelwerk.au 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Andrews,_Jim/mono-excerpt-Doppelwerk.mp2 3. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Andrews,_Jim/mono-Doppelwerk.mp2 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Andrews,_Jim/stereo-Doppelwerk.mp2 5. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/IN_001.html 6. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/EZ_001.html 7. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-comment.pl?Andrews,_Jim 8. mailto:jandrews@cybernetics.net 9. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Andrews,_Jim/html/songs.html 10. file://localhost/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',medium

Since hls early teens, Josh has had a dream to conquer the realms of musicology. From writirig song lyrics, to composing music to fit them to, Josh was never told he couldn\'t do it. In his twenty-one years he has reveled to the heights of his dream, mastering the art of playing several musical instruments, writing heart rendering lyrics, and arranging music that wlll set the hardest soul to dancing. To make the cycle complete, Josh has delved into the other side of the board and become a prolific producer as well. With two completed albums, \'Lifetimes\' (Rock alternative) with his \'Nowhere Dreamer\' band, and as a Soloist on the album \'Venus Butterfly\' -\'Tao of lust\', (Techno Dance,) Josh Mottley, and long time friend Doug Robertson have brought Adult Comedy Rap to the list of his ever growing repertoire of original productions wlth their newest endeavor, \'NASTY WABBIT.\' Although the finishing touches have yet to be put on this humorous demo, the two have gotten off to a great start wlth \'Naked Naked\' and \'Fire In The Hole.\' Doug Robertsom affectionately known as \'The Party Animal\' by Josh and their friends, was born and raised In Grand Rapids, Michigan on January the 8th. 1971.

Mottley, by now an old pro to the music industry, took \'Rappin\' Doug\' Into the studio to produce his first encounter into the music field. Doug took to the microphone like a duck takes to water. Before all the scratch vocals were laid for the music, Doug could be heard through the speakers calling to the engineer, \'Hey Rog, roll the damn tape.\' Doug has completed the first two songs on the demo under the dlrection of Mottley who wrote and arranged the music and also sang the back ground parts of the songs, \'Naked Naked\' and \'Fire In The Hole;\' both of which were lyrically written by Robertson.

The spoken word lyrics are somewhere between poetry and song lyrics: there are repeated elements as there would be in lyrics, but not bound by the verse/chorus format. As the material is not read as a poem would be, but spoken, the intent is for the listener to be able to take away something of what was heard, much as being able to remember a song\'s melody. In a creative blitz, 15 songs have been written and recorded from September of 1993 to today. KFJC, the radio station at 89.7 FM, is playing material from the demo tapes. Other radio stations are in the works. _________________________________________________________________ Member Bios: Tom Aragon -Keyboards and Guitar Tom has independently released Ascension, a collection of ambient musicla testures in the electronic/acoustic vein through his project, The Temple of Sound.

Opening with the Velvet Underground classic \"All Tomorrow\'s Parties\", Connie grabs hold of the song and never lets go. The band charges the opening chords with intensity and skill, creating a 3-D wall of sound built from electric guitars, clarinet and exotic percussion. Listening to the next few tunes, you begin to realize that La Strada is no ordinary singer/songwriter debut album. La Strada is truly an eclectic album. Each song is a story, stylistically ranging from rock to jazz, retro-pop to smoky torch song. Rarely before has there been a recording that successfully covers so many different styles of music. With La Strada Connie brings a new dimension to alternative music. \"One of the year\'s 10 best\" -- Detroit Metro times \"Judy Garland meets Iggy Pop\" -- Billboard \"Connie sings with torch-song virtuosity, a film noir siren\" -- CMJ \"It\'s one damn fine record\" -- BAM Connie Champagne -- La Strada (HEY 022) Heyday Records, 2325 Third Street, Suite 339, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

After a decade of recitals, competitions, and practice in both Suzuki and traditional methods, his interests led him to add contemporary rock-and-roll to his strict classical background. Since moving to Atlanta in 1989, Al Reingold has been has been playing music professionally, from accompanying well-known local artists on stage to scoring an all-original soundtrack for a local production of \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" From this seamless blend of the traditional and digital worlds, Reingold creates a hauntingly familiar sound, that gently stretches the boundaries from the classical realm to the New Age. Al Reingold uses these unique melodic lines to frame his debut, \"Stranger Looking In\" , which Reingold released on his own label, SLI Records, Ltd. This vast undertaking was completely arranged and produced by the artist himself, and ranges from rock-n-roll, to jazz, to blues, to classical and to the New Age. He recorded each piece with different guest musicians, including some of Atlanta\'s finest players. In addition to crafting the music and lyrics, Al Reingold plays piano, synthesizers, acoustic guitar, mandolin and percussion. Here\'s a listing of the players on the featured song, \"SPAIN\": Eliss Hadley, vocals Al Reingold, piano, rainstick David Patterson, classical guitar Chris McMahon, acoustic bass Matthew Kahler, congas Since releasing \"Stranger Looking In,\" Reingold has returned to the stage in Chicago and Atlanta, now performing his own compositions as a solo artist.

It seemed like a good idea at the time. However, by sheer coincidence, every single gig they tried to play, such as Kuwait City in January of 1991, or Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines, was canceled due to some kind of natural or human-caused disaster. Recently, Malcom vainly tried to put together a Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour following the latest United Nations declarations, but again war intervened and the tour was cancelled. Because of the Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour debacle, Deth Specula has many concert t-shirts left over, most of which are stored in Malcom\'s dad\'s garage.

We have always considered it a special song because members of Deth Specula, many of our fans, and close friends lost their jobs over the last couple of years. The song was recorded at the drummer\'s house on a Tascam 8-track cassette. Vocals (Timmy, Yam and Kozmo) were recorded on the back porch and the guitars (Malcom and Kozmo) were recorded in the bathroom. Drums (RaStRo!) were recorded in the bedroom and the bass (Yam) was direct. Although it was mastered on cassette (oh joy), the end result is not too shabby. However, we can\'t wait to rerecord this in a studio. Engineering was handled by Eric \"Sharky\" Davis, the Mystery Sixth Member of the band. Sharky takes care of our live sound, much of our recording, camera work, and general technical stuff. We couldn\'t have done it without him. Get Even More is one of our most popular live songs (along with our cover of \"Radar Love\" and our original \"(I\'m in Love with a) Gutterslut.\" We play it just as well live as on tape, in case you were wondering. :-) _________________________________________________________________ by Robert Lord of the IUMA staff December 29, 1993 _________________________________________________________________ I Wanna Be Updated is Deth Specula\'s bonus song for the IUMA. It\'s a spoof on the Ramones song I Wanna Be Sedated to reflect what it\'s like to working for a software company. Here\'some lyrics for example: Twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours to go, I wanna be updated. Nothing to do, nowhere to go, I wanna be updated. Get me to the trade show, put me on a plane. Send it to me Fed Ex, before I go insane. I can\'t control my budget, can\'t drink away the pain, Oh no no no no! These guys are a tight rock band and this song rules.

Penelope was heralded as the \"archetypal indomitable rock \'n\' roll woman and her band dubbed \"a major national musical asset\" by The New Touser Press Record Guide. Time matured her music; hard-edged noise became intricate melody, and raw anger became transformed into a bittersweet awareness of the human condition. Penelope was drawn to the evocative and immediate nature of acoustic instruments. In expanding the dimensions of her core sound, she added bandoneon, cello, accordion, soprano and bass clarinet, cornet, French horn, melodica and autoharp. Her work has evolved in terms of intimacy and depth of emotion, but she has lost none of the fierce intelligence that powered the music of the Avengers.

The CD is packed with emotion laden vocals, catchy guitars and most of all, memorable songs. Challenge is Arno Verstappen on guitar and Allison Lindsay on vocals. With the help of fellow musicians and friends, who appear on this first offering, this duo is a force to be reckoned with. Arno emphasizes that their goal is to make music which is less fad oriented. \"People have a hard time classifying our music because it\'s melodic, yet modern. Lately people seem to think that in order to be current, music has to be alternative or grunge. It\'s interesting, then, to note the current popularity of numerous melodic and classic rock bands. Since their songs have a timeless nature, they haven\'t had to jump on any trends to enjoy continued success. A position we want to be in. While few female singers have had long lasting, enduring careers, Allison feels the tide is turning, \"Artists like Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Raitt are paving the way for women with strong melodies and honest emotional vocals. It\'s time for us to cut out the gimmicks and get back to strong vocal lines and great songs.\" The two first met in Hollywood in 1991, when Amo was auditioning to find the singer that could bring life to his music. Originally from Holland, Arno came to Los Angeles in 1989 to study at GIT (Guitar Institute of Technology). After graduation, he decided to stay in town to form a band. \"There are a lot more opportunities in Los Angeles. In Holland, the rock scene is very small,\" Arno clarifies. \"Few bands from there, with the notable exception of Golden Earring (who have been a great inspiration), are able to make a comfortable living out of playing music.\" Coming from opposite sides of the Atlantic exposed the two musicians to different styles of music. How does that influence the band? \"Arno grew up listening to the great European rock guitarists. Guys with lots of feel and personality,\" explains Allison. \"My influence has come from the dynamics of American singers. You could say we are now able to incorporate the best of both worlds into our own music.\" As for lyrical content, the band touches on matters of the heart as well as more serious topics. Allison elaborates, \"Everyone can find themselves in a love song but we also like to address other matters that inspire and concern us. Such as the ups and downs that present themselves in everyday life. \" Next to being the voice for Challenge, Allison is gaining notoriety by teaching at Sabine Institute (for Vocal Strengthening and Development) in Los Angeles. Sabine Institute (established by renowned vocal coach Elizabeth Sabine) is famous for coaching many of rocks brightest stars including Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine, Brian Howe (Bad Co.). The Institute is currently branching out by bringing it\'s powerful technique to Japan, Australia and Italy. The band has every reason to be confident about the road ahead. \"We know the time is right for us,\" stresses Amo. \"Alternative and grunge have clearly textured the 90\'s with their realistic depictions of the life styles of today\'s youth. However, history shows us that music trends tend to move in waves and Challenge will be on the crest of the rising tide of new melodic rock.\" [Challengelogo.gif] Mail-order Instructions How to order of Challenge (7 song EP CD on Splash International Records) [9][CD cover] Within the U.S. Send a check or money order in the amount of $12.00 (includes shipping and handling) Outside the U.S. Send IRC (international money order) in U.S. currency in the amount of $15.00 (includes shipping and handling) Make Check or Money Order Payable to: Arno Verstappen Please mail to: ALV Music P.O.

As a collaborative group, they have written several hundred songs. While Black Rain\'s current play list consists of forty of their strongest tunes, they are continually writing and performing new material. One of the band\'s most noted performances took place at the California Mid-State Fair in August, 1993, where they opened up for the Damn Yankees, featuring Ted Nugent and Tommy Shaw. Other major California venues have included Dream Street in San Diego; Marquee in Westminster and the SLO Brew Company in San Luis Obispo. Black Rain\'s high energy live performances and area radio play have created an ever increasing consumer demand for their recorded music. Regional Wherehouse record stores continually sell through inventories of the band\'s latest LP titled \"Black Rain\". Black Rain\'s unique sound has been described as Rock with a Blues tinge. The band enjoys tremendous success in Central California and continues to win new fans of all ages. When not on stage, Black Rain can be found in the studio recording their newest songs.

35,'Crosswind Fairytales [1][AU Excerpt] [2][MPEG Mono Excerpt] [3][MPEG Mono] [4][MPEG Stereo] (Excerpt 160k, 240k / Full song 3:42 mins, 2.67M, 5.33M) [5]Rock ----------------------------------------------------------------- [ [6]|| Comments & Reviews [7]|| Email [8]|| Ordering Info ] [9][band photo] After years of experience and dedication this swirling musical mass known as Crosswind now surges to gale force. Fed by an encouraging musical climate and drawing from potent wells of knowledge and ability, Crosswind has developed into a serious storm of sound and fury, ready to establish sovereignty. Quickly take this opportunity to examine the conditions and prevailing atmospheric circumstances that have merged and intersected to proudly produce Crosswind. First there were simple honest goals which were almost always the truest direction to take. Often it takes a band or any collection of musicians a long time to arrive at that realization. Some never reach such a lofty level of understanding, but wallow hopelessly lost in bandwagon jumping, trend-observing confusion. Crosswind, however, is an example of a band whose members have come nearly full circle in development and found themselves staring squarely at the musical bottom line-- go with what you know!! Diligently working thir way through ideas,expectations, views and objectives, often by way of countless \"hell gigs\" - the members of this bluesy guitar-driven rock ensemble: vocalist Dana Hall, guitarist Scottie Jordan, bass player Rich Barefoot and drummer Dan Ross; have been savvy enough to grasp the concept that experience, a good work ethic and a straightforward stand is often the only way to rock and roll heaven. Sadly, today, the industry weather report frequently features bands that are here today, gone later today Not Crosswind! The band has gathered strength around a brooding, talented and misleading calm eye - lead vocalist Dana Hall. She is the focal center of the Crosswind storm. She and her compatriots know that while success would be wonderful, being good, really good, offers the greater reward. Thus, the die was cast, their lot thrown together. Crosswind was originally born out of the demise of several other Charlotte, N.C.-area bands. \"We were scared,\" Dana admits, \"we had to start over from scratch. Now, we\'ve done a lot of road work, that has helped me to understand the idea of entertainment. Now it feels so good to be up there singing for other people, not for me -- but for everybody out there!\" With well over 300 gigs under their belt, Crosswind has established a solid live show and appeared alongside major regional and national acts (yes, some of these bands are still around!) such as: .38 Special, Mothers Finest, Kansas, Nightranger, The Outlaws, Steppenwolf, Copperhead, Molly Hatchet, Three Dog Night, The Georgia Satellites and Cry of Love. Calling Crosswind a \"Southern-fried version of The Who\" Jordan believes that the availability of the bands music is a big part of the success equation. To fulfill that requirement, Crosswind recorded nine original songs on a cassette album entitled \"Can You Feel It?\" that they plan to distribute \"everywhere possible\". Recorded at White Room Studios in Charlotte, the new music on \"Can You Feel It?\" is a real representation of the soul of Crosswind.\"Our sound is simple\", says Hall. \"We write what we feel, not what we think we\'re expected to write.\" Calling the band\'s sound a mixture of Southern rock, anthem rock, the blues and hard rock, she adds \"This band has lots of energy. We pour it out onto the audiences in much the same fashion as a lot of 70\'s bands. We feed off the crowd and in return the crowd feeds off us.\" PRESS REVIEWS Their better original stuff leans toward moody Led Zeppelin and raucous Aerosmith and steers clear of wimpy Journey-isms. Dana Hall has a strong rock n\' roll voice, and they avoid the pretentious, ridiculous, stage-strutting monkeyshines of so many hard rockers. - Charlotte Observer, September 25 1993 Crosswind delivers straight ahead rock n\' roll as subtly as a slap in the face. A listen to the band\'s cassette \"Can You Feel It?\" proves us right. We felt it. - Asheville Citizen-Times, January 13, 1995 This Charlotte outfit mixes some solid guitar crunch, an attitude that\'s aggressive without being threatening and the pipes of CL Best of Charlottes Best Female Vocalist winner Dana Hall. - Creative Loafing February 1994 _________________________________________________________________ \"Can You Feel It?\" 9-song cassette of high energy, sultry, hard rockin\', bluesy, funky, southern kinda soundin thang with a bad female set of pipes up front!!! ======= [10][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume7/Crosswind/mono-excerpt-Fairytales.au 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume7/Crosswind/mono-excerpt-Fairytales.mp2 3. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume7/Crosswind/mono-Fairytales.mp2 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume7/Crosswind/stereo-Fairytales.mp2 5. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/lf-RR_012.html#Crosswind 6. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-ola-comment.pl?Crosswind 7. mailto:DanR4Wind@aol.com 8. file://localhost/iuma-bin/buy.pl?init=Crosswind 9. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/Crosswind.jpg 10. file://localhost/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',cold

The pair, who met when the poles of their portable IV\'s of Maintainizine collided on their way to shock treatment therapy, apparently were left to their own comedic devices when the TV broke in the day room last week. \"I\'ve listened to the CD and have concluded that Frau Lee and Herr Sea are too sick for this facility,\" said Chief of Psychiatry, Dr. Sy Cotic. \"I\'d mistakenly thought there was hope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon coming to meals with their gowns open in the front, but when they didn\'t respond to occupational therapy and got on this joke jag, I had to let them go. We simply cannot tolerate patients wasting valuable materials to make hand buzzers and fake barf,\" Dr. Cotic continued. Although unavailable for comment, \"Lee and Sea vehemently deny having made the CD while on the inside,\" an unidentified spokesman said. \"Actually, one day they were so bored, they escaped, unnoticed, and ended-up at a nearby grange hall in Chimacum, Washington where they happened upon a bunch of other former patients who were attempting to improvise eco-based comedy bits for Seattle area radio station, KSER. Trying to turn topics as grim as acid rain dripping through holes in the ozone into knee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right away. When Sea\'s old Radio Shack dictation machine caught fire,\" the spokesman continued, \"the other inmates fled. But Lee and Sea stuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which became the streams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led to the creation of Mouthbreather. With no hope of obtaining corporate financing, the desperate pair pooled their disability checks and held hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an award winning job of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken IV bottle at his throat. The result is seventy-two minutes of incisive, synapse blistering humor. Mouthbreather: Humor for the Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes. On CD and Cassette.

The grinding guitars and scraping metal percussion of \"idiot\'s planet\" lead into the hallucinogenic crawl of \"tsunami fungus.\" \"excruciate\" combines a thumping subsonic kick with extensive guitar work, while the sinuous bass and drum sounds of \"string (premonition v)\" blend together for a more Eastern flavor. \"afraid\" winds through tribal rhythms and crunchy guitars featuring a strange vocal melody which by the end sets the mood for \"near.\" \"zoviet-amerikka\" closes the CD with a hip-hop and funk rampage that fades into a classical ode to the decay of the U.S.A. \"nada is the product of years of frustrated attempts to create a distinctive band in the San Jose Area,\" said Robert M. Riddle IV. After playing with Autumn Cathedral, Riddle formed Swivelfaust and Slur before the decision to start nada as a solo project. Riddle enlisted the talents of other musicians, including Scott Martinez (Autumn Cathedral), Damien Gonzalez (Swivelfaust, Slur) and Mason Jones (Trance). The album was recorded at House of Faith in Palo Alto by Bart Thurber and produced by nada and Mason Jones. \"This is the most satisfying mix of electronic, experimental, psychedelic and rock music that I have been able to create so far.\" Nada uses influences as diverse as tribal drumming, techno sampling, hip-hop rhythms, wailing guitar and experimental noise to come up with a rich audio tapestry that is reminiscent of music by Coil, The Legendary Pink Dots and Savage Republic that should appeal most listening tastes.

If you ask most female songwriters who their main influence has been, 90% of them will name Joni Mitchell. Ask Eileen the same question and she doesn\'t hesitate. \"Dr. Seuss,\" she replies. This is not your average folksinger. Eileen got her start performing in comedy clubs in California. Although she did well in competitions, she wanted to emphasize her music as much as her humor, something that is not possible in the cut-throat world of stand-up comedy. When she moved east, Eileen concentrated on the music scene, quickly becoming a regular performer at folk festivals and coffeehouses. In addition to the humorous songs she brought with her, she began to write satirical songs about the culture shock of living in Washington, D.C., after growing up in California. \"...singular and damn near sociopathic...\" -- The Washington Post \"Eileen Joyner sings about problems in El Salvador and problems on the Beltway, about the importance of friendships and the importance of wearing underwear.\" -- Alexandria Gazzete Packet ======= [8][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Joyner,_Eileen/Joyner,_Eileen.jpg 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Joyner,_Eileen/mono-excerpt-Always_Wear_Underwear.au 3. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Joyner,_Eileen/mono-excerpt-Always_Wear_Underwear.mp2 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Joyner,_Eileen/mono-Always_Wear_Underwear.mp2 5. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/Joyner,_Eileen/stereo-Always_Wear_Underwear.mp2 6. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/FO_009.html#Joyner,_Eileen 7. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-ola-comment.pl?Joyner,_Eileen 8. file://localhost/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',cold

Singer, songwriter, arranger and performer, Eve B., has been performing in the Boston area since 1990 when she formed and fronted the band, Eve\'n Up. The band played Eve\'s original tunes in Boston clubs for three years headlining and opening for other area locals before Eve decided to go solo in 1993. Eve\'s musical past also includes the recording of a single on an independent European label in 1988, tours of Japan and France in 1988 and 1989, and more recently, performances with The Berklee College of Music Gospel Choir as a soloist in 1993. Among Eve\'s various musical projects are several self-produced demos. The most recent, a four-song CD entitled, Innocence, is the culmination of her performing and songwriting experience. The four songs on the CD were written, produced and arranged by Eve B. with assistance from songwriter/ guitarist, Andrea Bensmiller, who previously performed in the Boston acoustic scene. Eve and Andrea merged their talents in 1994 to form EB Productions and have since continued to write, arrange and produce together. [12][Innocence: album cover] The four tracks included on Innocence are \"Sexy Thing\", \"Innocence\", \"Invitation\", and \"Field of Hope\". Each tune showcases Eve\'s soulful, sultry, and purely original vocal style. Eve\'s creative and tasteful integration of vocal riffs and runs makes each tune breathe with soul and originality. The songs can best be described as a blend of pop and R&B with a strong gospel influence. Arrangements are characterized by the complex interweaving of keyboards and guitars, and lush harmonic backing vocals.

Emotionally charged and deep in meaning, Clan Diah produces sways from indie rock to heavier alternative. It\'s no wonder their appeal to the college scene keeps growing. Clan Diah is eclectic, yet ironically maintains a balanced, cohesive sound. They flow through a whole gamut of styles and sounds, but each song is uncontrived and honest. This sophisticated approach makes for timeless music. Clan Diah is song oriented with a communication of both mood and thought. This Cincinnati based quartet capitalizes on dynamics all through their debut CD \"The Train Journey North.\" If you haven\'t heard them have a taste and enjoy the Cincinnati style cookin\'. _________________________________________________________________ About the songs available on IUMA... SKY SIGN: This tribute to the unseen fully explores the use of dynamics. It refers to the sense that we believe in many things not yet seen, or invisible. We can see the future by study of the past and we can see the invisible by the results it produces. This song has interesting changes in time signature and moods. It trips, it flies, it spirals out of control. What is communication but transfer of ideas and moods? Words too are invisible and yet still exist. MIST COVERED MOUNTAINS: Simply Complicated and sadly beautiful. Christopher shows off some of his piping abilities on this piece. Originally composed by an unknown source in the early 1800\'s, this piece is sometimes rendered with Gaelic (trad. Scottish language) lyrics but more often the haunting melody is left alone to tell the tale of a traveler longing for the mist covered mountains of his home. This tune was a favorite of the late King George the VI and was played at his funeral. It was also played at the funeral of President John F. Kennedy. Highland bagpipes, acoustic guitar, and the distant harmonies of the whistles will leave an impression. SYMBOL OF MY SHAME: Very Emotional! This song demonstrates the winding melodies and thick guitars. Listen hard and you\'ll hear Jay\'s marching band past. This song is rich in meaning. It refers to the moving irony of the feast of Christ\'s last meal. It was caused by man\'s failure, yet caused man\'s redemption. He said it symbolized His death and His blood. He then gave thanks to God for it and ate it. _________________________________________________________________ [10][album cover] These three songs are only a taste of Clan Diah\'s independently released CD \"The Train Journey North\" which is available by sending $11.00 plus $2.00 postage and handling to.... Clan Diah 265 Emming Street Apt. #3 Cincinnati, Ohio 45219 _________________________________________________________________ Some more stuff for those who care... HISTORY OF CLAN DIAH In Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1991 a few college friends started writing songs. Clan Diah, as a band started with the stereotypical ritual of arguing over what to name the band. They settled on \"Clan Diah\" which is an old Scottish phrase meaning \"the children of God.\" This subtle reference to the divine nature of our humanity came from the Scottish influence of one of the members, Christopher McLennan, who is a nationally awarded bagpipe performer. After the name was chosen the band started playing out at local venues and coffee houses in the Cincinnati area. Over the years the band did some quick recordings of songs for a demo tape. One song (\"Matter of Time\") actually ended up on a nationally distributed compilation CD. With the confidence built by a very supportive local fan base, the success of the demo tape, and playing at a national music festival, the band embarked on its most ambitious endeavor yet... In July of 1994, Clan Diah went into the studio to start recording its first full length compact disc. This self produced, independently released, and personally financed album is a statement of the band\'s abilities, commitment, and pro-active nature. Clan Diah continues today to develop its loyal following. The band is presently shopping labels to give themselves the freedom to fully explore their potential. They wish you the best and hope you enjoy their work. See you on the \"Train Journey North.\" _________________________________________________________________ MEMBERS OF CLAN DIAH... CHRISTOPHER MCLENNAN: Lead Guitar, Bagpipes, Penny whistles Christopher is a 22 year old business major at the University of Cincinnati. From his young formative years he has played piano, violin, bagpipes, and the penny whistle. He was president of the Sycamore Orchestra and has won many national competitions on the bagpipes. He manages two apartment buildings, dabbles in the stock market, and is pipe major of the Caledonian Pipes and Drums of Cincinnati. He also has a certain preoccupation with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s \"Sherlock Homes.\" JAY HARNISH: Drums, Percussion, Exotic Coffee Jay is a 22 year old CAD operator at an engineering firm in Cincinnati. He has played drums since the age of ten. His eclectic music tastes and artistic abilities add to the band\'s persona. Along with being a CAD operator, Jay is also a talented model maker and is very gifted in the art of Calligraphy (note the band\'s logo). JEREMY PITTMAN: Bass Guitar Jeremy is a 20 year old saltpacker. Yes, you read correctly, he moves bags of salt. Jeremy has the strongest back in the band. He loves to play bass. That is all he talks about. We try to distract him but all he\'ll do is play bass and work a day job to pay for more bass gear. We are, however, hopeful that he might actually spend his money on something else: He\'s thinking of getting a tattoo. KENDALL FAULL: Lead Vocals, Guitar Kendall is a 23 year old college graduate. He has a bachelor of Arts in Ancient Hebrew and Greek literature. He also has a minor in public communications. He has been involved in the art of song writing for eight years.

No Winter was born in the Fall of 1979 in Aptos, California as a quartet. After stormy beginnings, the dust cleared and a tight, enduring trio (Robert, Jim and Dave) emerged called AURORA BOREALIS. Early original music had wide influences and took shape in arrangements which balanced song with intricate instrumental passages. As the band began to perform, numerous cover tunes crossing most musical boundaries (From Alabamas to Zeppelins) were added to the repertoire. This helped to keep a ride range of rooms filled, dancing, happy and intact. Always between the covers lurked the original songs. Throughout the years the band evolved, mutated, went into oblivion and returned from oblivion, leading to the current project - an eight song CD/Cassette. This was produced with two living in Northern California and the other in Southern California. Three of these songs are showcased here and the others are: Haven\'t I Cried Enough Queen of the Rodeo In Heaven I need some Lovin\' Message to the stars No Winter perpetually looks for musical/recording/exposure/performance opportunities.

Fused with playful structural psychadelics, this combination results in an explosive burst of pop that\'s been turned upside down, melded with darkness, and produces an intoxicating brew of melodic whimsy. Coat pushes the limits of noise! With their boy-girl-boy-girl line up, Coat can come off as gratifyingly raw or gleamingly pop. Yet this L.A. based quartet has a limitless capacity for drawing one in with achy guitar melodies. Their hyper-hypnotic rhythms combined with oddly accessible pop hooks, create a natural flowing buoyancy.

Originally formed in late 1992, the band has played numerous clubs in the New Haven area as well as the annual Summertime Street Festival. The band\'s instrumentation includes (but is not limited to) guitar, keyboards, bass and drums. On Nov. 5, 1994, the band released its first full-length CD, Scratch Tracks. This entirely independent release was co-produced with Jim Chapdelaine (Mr. Right). The CD contains 12 tracks for a total running time of 54:02 and includes an 8 panel full-color insert with lyrics, pictures, and graphics. Big Love is the first track off the CD to receive air time. All of us take turns at lead vocal which adds alot of variety to our music. Additionally, we each come to the band from different musical backgrounds, so our music moves through the entire spectrum of genres. The above song was chosen for distribution through IUMA because we feel it represents an intriguing combination of our musical interests. o Heather Nye: Keyboards, Percussion Heather is a native of Vancouver, WA, a Duke alum, a fourth year pharmacology major, and a first year med student. She plays an Ensoniq KS-32 and a Yamaha DX-7. Her influences are jazz/pop oriented and include Bonnie Raitt, Maria McKee, David Wilcox, and David Sandborn. o Mark Cassano: Guitar Mark is our resident guitar hero. He\'s a native of Danbury, CT and an NYU grad. Currently, he\'s finishing his degree in Economics while posing as a mild-mannered professor at Vassar. He plays a Hamer Special (made back in the days when Hamer was still a designer in the company) and thinks Richard Thompson is the greatest guitar player alive (but still listens to just about everything else.) o Marco Mazzi: Drums Marco still lives in New London, CT, his hometown for life, and makes the hour long drive for practices, shows, and classes. An RPI grad, he\'s studying electrical engineering. Marco plays Slingerland drums, is a big time Marillion fan, and knows a few guys named Vinny. o John McEachen: Bass, Harmonica, Guitar John hails from Woodbridge, VA and is also an electrical engineering major. A Notre Dame alum, he can consistently be found in front of the TV on Saturday afternoons. John plays a 6-string Alembic Elan. A former member of the defunct bluegrass combo Whistler\'s Brother, he has some pretty hefty country/folk persuasions. ======= [13][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume2/What_the_Cat_Dragged_In/What_the_Cat_Dragged_In.gif 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume2/What_the_Cat_Dragged_In/mono-The_Women_You\'ve_Become.mp2 3. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume2/What_the_Cat_Dragged_In/stereo-The_Women_You\'ve_Become.mp2 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/CO_006.html#What_the_Cat_Dragged_In 5. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/RR_008.html#What_the_Cat_Dragged_In 6. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/PO_005.html#What_the_Cat_Dragged_In 7. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-ola-comment.pl?What_the_Cat_Dragged_In 8. mailto:mceachen@noodle.med.yale.edu 9. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume2/What_the_Cat_Dragged_In/html/songs.html 10. file://localhost/iuma-bin/buy.pl?init=What_the_Cat_Dragged_In 11. http://noodle.med.yale.edu/~mceachen/intro.html 12. http://noodle.med.yale.edu/~mceachen/intro.html 13. file://localhost/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',hot

With roots grounded in a solid classical music background, Ms. Markay has worked with some of the top names in the industry, ranging trom Quincy Jones and Eric Clapton, to Carly Simon and George Duke. Her credits have also been splashed across Michael Jackson\'s \"BAD\" video, directed by Martin Scorsese, and on the Saturday Night Live band through Leon Pendarvis - the band\'s keyboard player with whom she worked. Ms. Markay started out by winning a scholarship to New York\'s prestigious Juilliard School of Music where she studied composition with Roger Sessions and developed into an outstanding classical pianist. But despite her exceptional ability as a classical musician, she could not be confined to that genre. While still wearing pigtails and braces on her teeth, Ms. Markay was called on to showcase her prodigious talents to the European community as part of a popular college rock and roll tour sponsored by a couple of Britain\'s better known producers. She met the challenge by performing to standing ovations on many European campuses. Upon arrival back to the United States, she was invited to perform in her own Miami Beach rock and roll review. She quickly followed that success with a dance music hit, \"It\'s Allrite,\" (released on WEA International in Holland). The tune wowed audiences in clubs all across the United States, and romped up the international music charts reaching an enviable No. 19 in Holland. That achievement was soon overshadowed by \"I Don\'t Wanna Be A Zombie,\" which zoomed to No. 2 on the French music charts, and demonstrated beyond a doubt that \"It\'s Allrite\" was no musical fluke. In between these many successes Ms. Markay further demonstrated her multi-faceted musical talents with solid credits in live performances, record dates, voice-overs, background vocals, and jingles for which she was in great demand in New York City where she lived and worked until moving to the West Coast two years ago. Ms. Markay recently completed her latest album, \"Change To Come\" which she composed, arranged and produced, and on which she is also the lead vocalist and plays a number of musical instruments. The album features a dazzling array of background musicians, and has been getting rave reviews trom a number of well-respected music critics. [15][album cover] Album Song Listing: CHANGE TO COME WOMAN OF LIGHT I AM THE RIVER NOBODY BOOGOOYAGA BABY SUNSHINE FALLEN ANGEL STRANGE FORTUNE MAN FROM THE STARS WAKE UP AND LIVE STILL NEED YOU \"Boogooyaga\" (from the album \"Change To Come\") 3:48 min. (a Caribbean word meaning lack of sophistication) \"Change To Come\" 3:48 min. DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC: \"Change To Come\" is an exciting, eclectic combination of songs which underscores the artist\'s spiritual and professional growth. The 11 tunes featured on this album shows a sensitivity for and understanding of the troubling issues which threaten to ravage our world--women\'s rights, the environment, the human condition, intolerance, and the overriding need for universal love. Markay has pulled this universality of themes together with an ingenious and exuberant intermingling of musical styles. The album is a triumph. Markay\'s fine-tuned musical acumen create an album that is professionally well-crafted, stylish and musically superior. The result is a commercially viable yet creatively exceptional gem that is destined for success! REVIEWS: \"Women\'s rights, independence, unconditlonal love & guardian angels ... Markay has a true talent and this album is a shining showcase with her great radio-ready voice ... and top notch self-written pop songs--a winner!\" Heartsong Review \"...ingenious & exuberant intermingling of musical styles ... the album is a triumph! DON\'T MISS IT!\" Radcliffe Joe - Words & Music \"It\'s hard not to be impressed with what a success \"Change To Come\" is as she traffics in a variety of upbeat styles, including jazz, pop, R&B, and a sort of torch song/rock balladry (the well-crafted \"Fallen Angel\") hybrid that works well ...she has top-flight musicians who really shine on funky workouts like \"Nobody\" and \"Strange Fortune\"...Markay pulls it all together with guts and flair - a fine album\" Steve Roeser - Note 4 Note CREDITS: Written, Arranged, and Produced by Barbara Markay Recording engineer: Joseph Armillas Guitar: Jeff Mironov Bass guitar: Wayne Petswater Synthesizers and drum programing: Barbara Markay Horns: performed and arranged by Tom Malone Background vocals: Julie Eigenberg, Barbara Markay, Joseph Armillas Congas: Gumbi Ortiz Lead Vocals- Barbara Markay For more information: PO BOX 25156, Los Angeles, California 90025 310-575-9829 Available on CD and Cassette at all Tower Records and HMV stores (USA) or through IUMA. ======= [16][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/Markay,_Barbara.jpg 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/mono-excerpt-Change_to_Come.au 3. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/mono-excerpt-Change_to_Come.mp2 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/mono-Change_to_Come.mp2 5. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/stereo-Change_to_Come.mp2 6. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/FO_009.html#Markay,_Barbara 7. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/RR_026.html#Markay,_Barbara 8. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/PO_015.html#Markay,_Barbara 9. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/WO_002.html#Markay,_Barbara 10. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-ola-comment.pl?Markay,_Barbara 11. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/html/songs.html 12. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/html/lyrics.html 13. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume4/Markay,_Barbara/html/videos.html 14. file://localhost/iuma-bin/buy.pl?init=Markay,_Barbara 15. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/Change_to_Come-cover.jpg 16. file://localhost/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',hot

[10][Pipsqueaks logo] Biographical Information: In 1984 Lois LaFond had two of the most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, who were four and five years old. She searched high and low, in and out, up and down, by and through, far and wide, but couldn\'t find the kind of music she really liked made especially for Children (like smokin\' saxophones and percolatin\'percussion). So, being one to do whatever was necessary for those two most gorgeous, talented and astounding Children on the face of the earth, she decided to put out an album of her own with Reggae, Salsa, Blues,Ballads, Rock & Roll and African grooves. As she had been in the adult music scene for some number of years in the Boulder-Denver area, she had access to some of the greatest musicians to be found anywhere. And, as it worked out, in 1985, she had her third baby: I AM WHO I AM! This recording put her on the map as one of the premier American artists making modern music for young Children. At the same time she gathered four of Colorado\'s really rockin\' players and formed LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES -- one of the early five-piece bands to hit the road for Kids. Now this World Beat sound satisfied those two gorgeous, talented and astounding Children, who also composed many of the songs with LaFond. Soon LaFond found out that many other Children-- as well as their parents -- were absolutely thrilled with her recording. People said things like, \"I really don\'t mind that my Child plays this tape over and over and over and over and over and over. I really like it, too!\" Reviews poured in from all over the country from newspapers and magazines, parents and teachers, and -- most importantly -- from Kids. I AM WHO I AM! became a signature tune which put LaFond in the forefront of composing and producing songs of self-esteem and diversity -- years before they were the buzzwords of today. Classrooms started using the music, as did Spinabifida Centers, ARC Centers and Very Special Arts Festivals around the country. Encouraged by the response, LaFond decided to make another record in 1986. And another one in 1987. And another one in 1989. Each recording brought more rave reviews, positive comments and responses from publications like THE L.A.PARENT, PARENTS\' CHOICE, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE, DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE, GRAMMY MAGAZINE, American Library Association\'s BOOKLIST, PRE-K TODAY, MUSIC EDUCATOR\'S JOURNAL, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, Jill Jarnow\'s ALL EARS, Laurie Sale\'s GROWING UP WITH MUSIC .. . . In fact, there were so many reviews that there was no way to keep track of them anymore! LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES\' songs were played on RADIO AAHS, WE LIKE KIDS of KTOO, Alaska, PICKLEBERRY PIE out of Santa Cruz, WCBS-TV in New York, and on CONTINENTAL,LUFTHANSA, and DELTA Airlines Children\'s in-flight programming. Of course, people started calling for shows with the ROCKADILES. So they toured their original participatory concerts to thousands of Children from New York to Oregon and from Alaska to Florida at places like New York\'s CENTRAL PARK, HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT, and ST.PETER\'S CATHEDRAL. Then, in 1995, LaFond produced her fifth album, TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN. So now the Rockin\' ROCKADILES\' concerts include songs from this new recording as well as I AM WHO I AM! and their very popular ONE WORLD. Soon LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES will be touring throughout COLORADO and in CHICAGO, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, and WASHINGTON, D.C. If you are in these areas, they might just be able to come to your community. You can call HEATHER NOTO at AGENCY WEST (303-652-3421) to bring ROCKADILES to YOUR town -- wherever you are!! One thing Lois LaFond knows for sure is that every Child she gets to meet now is gorgeous, talented and astounding. BAND MEMBER LIST: LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES\' live show paints a rainbow of words that kids love, messages that parents appreciate, and great music that pulls it all together in the World Beat. Mother, singer, songwriter, producer, and speaker, LOIS LaFOND spent most of her life in the performance arts of dance, music, mime, and theatre, as well as teaching. Lois first made her mark in the adult world of music as vocalist and lyricist. She then brought her varied styles of music to the hearts of Children -- writing, producing, and recording five albums for Children and their families. Her sophisticated world music enjoys national acclaim from the L.A. PARENT and PARENTS\' CHOICE to BILLBOARD and DOWNBEAT magazines. Her songs appear on several international airlines and commercial and promotional videos. Her spoken voice is heard on voice-overs for video and radio productions as well as commercials. She is a featured speaker at NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN Conferences and sits on the faculty of THE PEOPLES NETWORK. Her many years of experience in the disciplines of teaching, music, and the performing arts combine to create the ultimate in entertainment for the entire family. THE PLAYERS: Drummer GORDON KENNEDY has been a musical mainstay in the ROCKADILES. He is featured on all of LaFond\'s recordings and in her opinion, \"Gordon has everything: great rhythm, keen ears,and a wild sense of humour.\" Kennedy started drumming on potato chip cans at 13. Now his styles range from rock to freeform improvisation with his current band, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. His drumming credits include, as he says, \"Too many bands to be significant.\" He has opened for TALKING HEADS, THE RAMONES and KING SUNNY ADE. Kennedy says, \"With Children, there are no pretensions. It\'s just plain fun to work with THE ROCKADILES.\" Keyboardist REBECCA MARTIN began playing the piano at the age of six,and went on to earn a B.A. in Music and a Masters in Piano Performance and Pedagogy. Her talent for improvisation is seen in her jazz combo, THE REBECCA MARTIN TRIO, and the big band PANDAEMONIUM. She is an outstanding classical pianist who performs both solo and duet. She has taught piano for 21 years, specializing in the Suzuki method for young Children. Rebecca composed the piano music on LaFond\'s third tape SOMETHING NEW! Bassist CHICO MEIRA also plays guitar, sings and composes. He began studying guitar as an eight year old child in Rio de Janeiro. The traditional music of Brazil which he brings to the band encompasses Samba, Bossa Nova, Chorinho, and African as well as Brazilian rhythms. He played in many rock bands in his native country and was the major force behind the band PAO BRASIL providing both classical guitar and vocals. Currently, in addition to ROCKADILES, he plays bass and percussion with CONGUEROS DEL ALMA while working as a full time bio-engineer. Saxophonist MARK HARRIS has played everything from what he calls \"way-avante-honk-and- squeak music\" to the Colorado Symphony. Whatever the style, his preference is to play original music. His favorite style is world beat dance music with his band, MONKEY SIREN. Mark has played for shows with Bob Hope, Joe Williams, The Temptations, and Diane Schuur. He teaches sax at Metro State College of Denver and has appeared as a featured classical soloist with their wind ensemble. He performs on many recordings including those of Ron Miles, Fred Hess, and Janet Feder. He says, \"Kids are swell.\" MARK McCOIN has played drums and percussion for 25 years gaining a national reputation for his musical scoring, art installations, and sound designs across the country. He has performed in America, Indonesia and Singapore. Mark has composed numerous theatre and dance scores for the DENVER CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS and the DAVID TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY. He founded the DENVER GAMELAN and was co-producer of the highly successful NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO series, TERRA INFIRMA. Mark has composed numerous original soundscapes.

I just started thinking of the craziest combinations of words that started with the same letter. I like to pass on to kids some of what are called \"figures of speech\" in the English language, and this one is always a lot of fun. You can make up your own alliterations -- try any letter. \"One World\" originated as a song for adult audiences. Its groove has an mbaganga influence from South Africa, also called \"township jive.\" When recording my Children\'s album, I thought \"One World\" would be a great choice to include for kids since it always got a such a hearty response from dancing adults. I try not to do any less for kids than I do for adults. Press Reviews About TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (song included online): P.J. SWIFT, PICKLEBERRY PIE: \"This is miles above what most other people are doing right now.\" JILL JARNOW, ALL EARS: \"Maybe this one will finally make Lois LaFond the superstar she should be.\" JASON FELD, DISTRIBUTOR FOR HEADSTART: \". . . highly educational and valuable teaching tools in promoting self esteem, social/emotional development and the beauty of cultural diversity among young Children.\" Chosen for in-flight Children\'s programming on DELTA AIRLINES. About ONE WORLD (song included online): PARENTS\' CHOICE: \"LaFond\'s ticket to the broader audience she deserves.\" BILLBOARD MAGAZINE: \"I was knocked out . . . as good as anything I\'ve heard.\" L.A. PARENT: \"Celebratory anthems of peace, love and unity in a musical patois that speaks for itself.\" Chosen for in-flight Children\'s programming on LUFTHANSA AIRLINES. ADDITIONAL LOIS LaFOND RECORDINGS About I AM WHO I AM!: L.A.PARENT: \". . .the practically perfect children\'s song, teaching self-respect and tolerance to an instantly singable refrain.\" American Library Association BOOKLIST: \"The tunes are lively, catchy, and easy to learn.\" Evan, 5 years old: \"I think I really love it.\" About SOMETHING NEW!: PRE-K TODAY: \"A must for your infant room!\" Julie Carpenter, MD: \"It is wonderful to watch these melodies and Lois\' beautiful singing calm irritable and sick newborns.\" TATTERED COVER: \"A first rate addition to the world of children\'s music.\" About WHILE CREATURES OF SUMMER SLEEP: GEORGE WINSTON: \"enjoyable. . . uncluttered and refreshing . . . .

Merchandise Description: TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (LL-05c and LL-05cd) (Song \"Alliteration Sensation\" included online) In this hot new release, LaFond does turn it all upside down.

LaFond has turned to an exciting array of over 40 percussion instruments from around the world including the Australian Didgeridoo, the Brazilian Berimbau and the American Washboard -- and everything in between. Singing of everything from numbers in three languages to a changeable creature named Zuppie, this recording also includes a parade, movement songs and a 5-minute relaxation process. PLUS, based on LaFond\'s highly successful workshop: \"USING MUSIC IN THE CLASSROOM: YOU DON\'T HAVE TO BE BEETHOVEN,\" she has compiled a manual of hands-on ideas for Parents and Teachers to use the songs to teach all the disciplines including Language, Math, Art, Imagination, and more. Hailed by teachers and parents and, especially, kids. Geared for the Child 4-7. Songlist: Celebrate! Alliteration Sensation Stop & Go Numbers All Around!

Blooz in Zb Anyway I Can Palmas Turn Around ONE WORLD (LL-04) (Available on CD for radio play or demo; soon to be publicly released on CD)(Song \"One World\" included online) Danceable, singable WORLD BEAT MUSIC for Children of all ages, this album was the first of its kind in the Children\'s market. Before Paul Simon\'s GRACELAND was released, the Rockadiles were writing Afro-Pop songs for the highly successful Denver dance band for adults, ORCHESTRA KING MAMA. This sound is captured on ONE WORLD, which includes African/Caribbean-influenced music styles such as soca and mbaganga, as well as blues, gospel, jazz, klezmer,reggae, and ballads. Geared for the Child of all ages. This percolating music will get the whole family moving and singing together from the first tune!

Lou Reed and Rosanne Cash rolled into one.\" Spin magazine called Barbara\'s first album Scissors one of the best albums of the decade. In the Gavin Report, musician Robyn Hitchcock named Scissors one of his top ten favorites along with albums by Roxy Music, REM, Richard Thompson, and Elvis Costello. The Village Voice said \"Barbara Manning can make waves in a sea of sarcasm with introspective pretty songs about heavy shit. Her voice makes the edge seem like a place to warm yourself....her Nick Drake dread was cut with punk derision, her Suzanne Vega lilt was frosted with anxiety and her folky ear was full of Wire and the Fall.\" Scissors, originally released in 1988 on vinyl, was out of print for several years. As a special bonus, the CD and cassette formats of One Perfect Green Blanket includes all ten cuts from the Scissors LP as well. Guest musicians helping out on the album include Kim Osterwalder from Flophouse on cello, Melanie Clarin from Harm Farm on drums, and Steve Michner from Big Dipper on bass. Barbara has developed a strong cult following over the past several years with her frequent live shows on both coasts. Barabara\'s music is regularly heard on college radio across the country.

I give God all the glory for my inspiration and I am sure there are many that claim inspiration, but the Book of James says that every good and perfect gift comes from the Father, and what perfection there is in my music is a gift from the God of the United States. It usually takes me between 10 and 20 minutes to write a song, usually less, and I rarely have corrections to make, only minor ones, a conjunction or the like. I am 55 this July, should the Lord let me continue to live, and am co-owner in a dental laboratory with my husband. I have run for office three times, holding up the principes of free enterprise which made this nation great and which will explain my concern for a real market, I am founder of a publishing company and missionary society, again in conjunction with my wonderful husband and am an ordained minister of the gospel. I have a daughter and a son, two step-daughters and beloved grandchildren. I have dedicated my life to rebuilding America with a special dedication and burden of bringing glory to my forefathers of God\'s music. I have written over 200 songs and poems, but find that the stronghold of merchandising control makes it nearly impossible to promote any music beyond what is according to someone\'s preplanned agenda. The old saying says, \"Let me write the music of the nation, and I care not who writes the laws.\" I will continue to write and trust God to punish thieves and make them pay back fourfold, in this life, as well as in eternity.

I don\'t like to define my style because I have always felt that was someone else\'s job. I like to write about things I feel passionate about and communicate my feelings through songwriting. I think my music is unique because although I\'d like a career in music, that is not my motivation. Making music is very spiritual and songs are like prayers for me. My songs are always analytical, sometimes topical and occasionally political because I want the listeners to get emotional about, think about or get angry about a subject they were previously unfamiliar with. I think a good song can get under your skin and bring up emotions you never knew were there.

The idea was to make my voice not only sing the lyrics but also sound like a guitar. Then for the guitar to tell the rest of the story when I stopped singing the lyrics. I\'m very proud of this production because it\'s the first record I produced that sounds exactly the way I wanted it to sound. I also incorporated elements of \"Hey Joe\" and other Hendrix riffs into this song. America: I wanted this to sound like it\'s coming from the point of view of a Native American which is why I used tribal drum sounds. This is combined with military marching band sounds because the song is about how greed, power and the desire for world domination can destroy a beautiful country.

Her debut recording Point of Departure was described by a New York radio personality as \"Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman.\" (Huh?) See, it\'s not quite pop, not quite jazz, not quite blues, not quite folk -- and yet, a little of each. And some of it\'s kind of, well ... funny. What\'s a radio programmer to do? Well ... play it! And they have ... at WXPN in Philadelphia ... WGBH in Boston ... the \"Z-100 Morning Zoo\" in New York city ... KSER in Seattle... even Radio Riga in Latvia! (Yes, Latvia.) And listeners love it. On Point of Departure Mary Ellen and producer Paul Guzzone are more musically extravagant than is currently feasible in her live shows. Here, the Patty Larkin song \"Caffeine\" is a full-fledged big-band number. Other tracks feature (live, not sampled) Brazilian percussion, horn sections, even bird calls. (Okay, the bird calls are sampled -- with permission, of course.) \"We tried desperately to use every musician in New York,\" Mary Ellen says of the undertaking. \"We didn\'t, but you still get your money\'s worth.\" Mary Ellen has been playing live at such Northeast clubs as The Iron Horse Music Hall in Northampton, MA; The Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem, PA; The Bitter End in New York city, The Towne Crier in Pawling, NY and other folk clubs, coffee houses, jazz & blues rooms, theaters and festivals. She\'s opened shows for Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, John Sebastian and Saffire: Uppity Blues Women. Backed by keyboards and bass/acoustic guitar (and sometimes violin), her concerts center mostly on rootsy blues and jazz, bittersweet ballads and her signature \"wacky production numbers.\" \"Caffeine\" has become one of these and so has the John Prine/Fred Koller collaboration \"Let\'s Talk Dirty in Hawaiian.\" Recently some original tunes have entered this category as well. \"My mission is to disprove the theory that no one ever laughs in a folk club,\" she states. \"I\'ll be working on jazz clubs next.\" Order NOW!

Originating from the Bay Area, which has provided a breeding ground for several top-notch Industrial groups that have become major forces in the international world of music, God Dog is one of the newer \"Tech Metal\" groups to burst upon the scene. God Dog consists of the electronic and vocal talents of Steve Severino and guitarist/programmer, Mike Vaughn. The two have been working extensively since the fall of 1993 and have released a full-length independent CD, \"Of Love, Death and Blood\", as well as performing several live shows. The self professed goal of God Dog is to take the combination of metal and electronic technology to areas yet to be explored. Their sound takes this union and manipulates it in a way that is innovative and exciting yet not experimental in terms of song structure and melody. God Dog will appeal to people who like to hear Industrial music through a straight line rather than a jagged tunnel. With the addition of drummer, programmer and synth master, Ben Padilla, God Dog are expanding their live shows and adding a plethora of new sounds and styles to new material while maintaining their Industrial edge. Emphasis on diversity and quality, a commitment to integrity, a concentrated effort toward constant productivity and a growing loyal fan base mean God Dog will be around for years to come. Band info and the full-length 50min CD release, GOD DOG \"Of Love, Death, and Blood\" is available by writing: GOD DOG: PO BOX 1124 SOQUEL, CA 95073 EMISSION: Emission, showcasing the talents of God Dog, is a combination of heavy guitar and driving beats interspersed with quieter moments of synth and programming orchestration. The track is further enhanced by layers of electronic mayhem. The songs lyrics, delivered in a heavily distorted yet unique Industrial vocal style are about individuality and personal expression while not getting weighed down by the opinions and expectations of others. An over all intense and aggressive song, God Dog feel it is one of the stronger tracks off their new full-length independent CD release \"Of Love, Death, and Blood\". ======= [13][Fine Oak Finished Toolbar] Copyright (C) 1995 Internet Underground Music Archive References 1. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ads/html/musase/edu-16.html 2. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/ftmp/lv0/IUMA/ftp/music/God_Dog/index.html 3. file://localhost/ad-bin/redirect?musase 4. file://localhost/IUMA-2.0/olas/sponsor/sponsor.html 5. http://www.iuma.com/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/God_Dog/mono-excerpt-Emission.au 6. http://www.iuma.com/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/God_Dog/mono-excerpt-Emission.mp2 7. http://www.iuma.com/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/God_Dog/mono-Emission.mp2 8. http://www.iuma.com/IUMA-2.0/ftp/volume3/God_Dog/stereo-Emission.mp2 9. http://www.iuma.com/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/HC_003.html#God_Dog 10. http://www.iuma.com/IUMA-2.0/olas/genre/HM_002.html#God_Dog 11. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/view-ola-comment.pl?God_Dog 12. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/buy.pl?init=God_Dog 13. http://www.iuma.com/iuma-bin/nimagemap/IUMA-2.0/imaps/bandage-toolbar.map',cold

Such is the case of Twice Removed, the astonishingly mature debut from New York\'s distant cousins. Like their moniker, distant cousins are lower case in an upper-case world, a unique school of fish ready to burst out of a big pond with the eclectic bag of tricks they display on Twice Removed. First of all, these cousins are slyly deceptive. While the playful cover art and buoyant, rambling rhythms first suggest a party band, on closer inspection Twice Removed\'s songs have dark roots that add depth to their danceability. The album\'s opener, the raucous \"Elvis Did Karate\" is a camp classic, but singer/songwriter/guitarist Catherine Dail\'s husky wail imparts a simmering sensuality that\'s more Chrissie Hynde than downtown dilettante. And \"Gotta Fly,\" opening with awkward, tentative bass notes reminiscent of Talking Head\'s \"Psycho Killer,\" turns into a Beatlesque rocker that details the ups and downs of an obsessive relationship that refuses to end. Even \"Tambourine Girl\" a seemingly innocuous song propelled by bright vocals and upbeat island riddims, describes a lovable misfit unable to fit in, who \"does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when it comes to guitar playin\' that girl ain\'t got the touch.\" Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song. Twice Removed ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and blue-eyed soul of \"Pony\" (where Dail strongly tells her lover \"don\'t ride me baby, I\'m not your pony\") to sophisticated, jazzy pop like the smoky \"Three Things\" and quietly longing \"Love\'s Here Now\". distant cousins even manage to make having the \"Minnesota Blues\" sound like fun; combining a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, \"Minnesota Blues\" suggests an unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors. Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins\' familial musical virtuosity. On \"Elvis Did Karate\" lead guitarist Jon Diamond brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches to a mariachi stroll on \"Burning Words.\" As well, Joe \"Mama\" Holland\'s harmonica provides a questioning counterpoint to the lyrics on \"No Exception\" and Fred Gildes\' subtle trombone shadings on \"Pony\" suggest an indecision hiding behind Dail\'s outwardly tough stance. When necessary, distant cousins aren\'t afraid to bring in bongos, timbales, organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove. And they\'re no strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that ornament the otherworldly jam session \"Lucky Magnet.\" Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the in-betweens. And from the sound of Twice Removed, these cousins won\'t be distant for long. Be sure to bring the family. _________________________________________________________________ distant cousins\' \"Twice Removed\" has really hit the college radio waves with great success across the country. The band has been on the road early in \'94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New Hampshire to rockin\' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere. On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter End, etc!
