% Abstract
% 
%    This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings
%    of a single user on these web pages. The web pages are on four
%    seperate subjects (Bands- recording artists; Goats; Sheep; and
%    BioMedical)

% Data Characteristics
% 
%    The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at each web page
%    and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100 pages per
%    domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn user
%    profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
% Data Format
% 
%    Each subject is in a seperate directory. Within each directory, there
%    is an file named "index". The index contains information on the other
%    files. Each entry is a line of the form:
%  file-name  |  rating  |  url  |  date-rated  |  title
% 
%    where file-name is the name of a file (usually an integer), rating is
%    hot, medium, or cold. There are so few medium's that mediums are
%    usually merged with cold in experiments.
% 
%    The other fields aren't used in learning, but they are collected by
%    the interface for other purposes. They are the url of the html source,
%    the date rated and the title of the web oage.

% Problem Description
% 
%    The problem is to predict user ratings for web pages (within a subject
%    category). The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at
%    each web page and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100
%    pages per domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn
%    user profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
%    The accuracy of predicting ratings is reported in early publications.
%    Later publications used the precision at top N or the F-measure.
% 
% Results
% 
%    The initially study compared traditional meachine learning methods
%    with IR methods. A variety of learning algorithms worked acceptably,
%    including naive bayes, nearest neighbor, and Rocchio's method

2,'The Goat Shrine This page is fondly dedicated to Heidi Geshel, who knows the joys of living in a goat-infested room and who also gave me the wit and inspiration to do this page! [1][titlegoat.GIF] GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! GOATS! [toggoat.GIF] Why are Goats so Cool? Oh, c\'mon, just look at them. They\'re amazing. Not only are they cute, but what other animal are you going to find that both eats your garbage and can make its own milk? Exactly. Besides, goats are just cool by nature. They make great sources of consolation in times of grief, plus there are many unconfirmed rumors that they also make good sex counselors too. The Beard: An Evolutionary Link Truly, Darwin was on to something. Think about it. Goats have beards. People have beards. Hmm...could it be we that we and goats have a closer family bond than we\'d previously believed? And if so, why, goats may be on par with monkeys, dolphins, and white mice in intelligence. Why, this practically makes goats family to us! Fear from the Masses Yes, that\'s right, most people just can\'t handle the power that goats represent. That\'s why our society is trying to put them down and repress the danger that goats hold for the weak-willed\'s stagnant and close-minded ways of life. Goats offer us freedom--a new and enlightened way of life that will help us transcend the mundaneness of the everyday world and take us to the ultimate level of perfection that we possess within ourselves. So don\'t be decieved by claims that goats are only good for milk and cheese or angora and cashmere. Realize that those beliefs are only the last-chance efforts of a desperate group of people trying to pose as a stumbling block to the new order. Only by knowing the truth can you become free. [white_goat.GIF] How Did I Become Hooked? Well, I really don\'t know. This hobby/interest/obssesion of mine has been going on for a few number of years now, but I can\'t quite pinpoint how it started. Mostly I think I saw some goats at a fair and was struck by how cute they can be. Plus, liking goats isn\'t quite the same as liking dolphins or puppies, so the attention/amusement factor I get from this is worth it. Besides, the quest for finding goat &quotthings\" isn\'t easy, so it makes for a fun time. However, the love of goats is a double-edged sword which isn\'t always easy to wield. One example was when I took my niece (who was 3 years old back then) to a petting zoo which had goats who were intent on mobbing her and eating her clothing. I &quotrescued\" her, and she\'s recovered quite nicely since then (thanks to many readings of &quotThe Three Billy Goats Gruff,\") but the whole incidence just shows that goats have a dark side that can be unleashed if their power isn\'t properly reckoned with. [small_kimball.GIF] My Goats For those of you that care (and heck, I\'m impressed if anyone\'s actually read this far!), I have my own collection of goats. Ok, they\'re not real live goats, but I think terming them as merely inanimate is harsh, as these goats definitely have a personality and prescence all their own.

7,'[beans.gif] Kaldi & the Dancing Goats There are many versions of how coffee came to be but by far the most famous is that of Kaldi & the Dancing Goats. \"Once upon a time in the land of Arabia Felix, there lived a goatherd named Kaldi. Kaldi was a sober responsible goatherd whose goats were also sober, if not responsible. One night, Kaldi\'s goats didn\'t come home, and in the morning he found them dancing with abandoned glee near a shiny, dark-leafed shrub with red berries. Kaldi soon determined that it was the red berries on the shiny, dark-leafed shrub that caused the goats\' eccentric behavior, and it wasn\'t long before he was dancing too. Finally, a learned imam from a local monastery came by, sleppily, no doubt, on his way to prayer. He saw the goats dancing, Kaldi dancing, and the shiny, dark-leafed shrub with the red berries. Being of a more systematic turn of mind that the goats or Kaldi, the learned imam subjected the red berries to various experimental examinations, one of which involved parching and boiling. Soon neither the imam nor his fellows fell asleep at prayers, and the use of coffee spread from monastery to monastery, throughout Arabia Felix, and from there to the rest of the world.\" (Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing, & Enjoying: Kenneth Davids) _________________________________________________________________ [copy.gif]',cold

_________________________________________________________________ Why raising goats is fun Goats are fun because they all have different personalities and have different little habits that can be amusing or interesting. Goats are very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good scratch. Most goats\' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes. It is very rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have kids and grandkids of her own. With goats that doesn\'t have too take too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to breed when they are just a year old. It\'s also neat to learn how to milk or trim hooves and other things that you wouldn\'t ordinarily be able to do. _________________________________________________________________ Goat Statistics 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Body Temperature: 102.5° F-104° F 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Pulse/heart rate: 60 to 80 beats per minute 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Respiration rate: 15 to 30 breaths per minute 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Puberty: 4 to 12 months 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Estrus (\"heat\") cycle: 18 to 23 days 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Length of each \"heat\": 12 to 36 hours 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Gestation (length of pregnancy): [28]150 days [new.gif] 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Breeding season: Pygmy goats may be bred any time of the year.

We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a bucket of water. In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the water doesn\'t freeze, but we don\'t have that problem. Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a day and still have perfectly healthy goats. You will have to decide what is practical for your animal and your schedule. Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be soiled by the goat. The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult dairy goat doe eats about 1/2 flake a day (about 5 pounds). This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein depending on the additional needs of the goat: 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Dry doe: 0-1 pounds 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Wethers: Usually given no grain. We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper calcium-to-phosphorous ratio. Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your area. _________________________________________________________________ Preventative health care In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia. We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent \"white muscle disease\" in kids. Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of body weight twice a year. The best time for bred does to receive BoSe is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid. Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc), unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the Clostridium Perfringens types C&D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given. It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at 21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow. Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations. When using the combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod vaccine. Check with a local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of injectible you use. Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal. In your area, additional vaccines for other diseases may be necessary. We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in the spring immediately following kidding. We use TBZ or paste wormers intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate (Strongid C). Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat. Check labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption. _________________________________________________________________ Common Diseases Coccidia are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat. Sometimes a goat with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft stool or no obvious symptoms at all. You might not suspect a problem until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they should. Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and should be treated at least once with the medication Albon. Our veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats. Ketosis (also known as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The doe may be depressed, weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance. If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early in the disease, many does will show a positive test for ketone bodies in the urine. Ketosis may occur when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when the doe is very fat. This disease is caused by the sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat to eat enough of her normal diet to provide this energy (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will rapidly metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at two to three ounces twice a day will help. If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful unless she delivers at that time. As a preventive measure, do not let the doe get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay. [29]Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome (CAE) is a viral disease. In young kids symptoms include a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite, However, the unused legs lose muscle strength and structure and the infected kids eventually die. In older goats, the same disease is seen as swollen joints, particularly the knees. The disease develops slowly, and after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using its legs properly. Infected goats have no fever, remain alert, and eat well. However, they do not recover from the arthritis. An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE. The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by contact or through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective procedures or treatments. Isolating kids at birth and raising them on pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It\'s a good idea to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test only checks for antibodies, and it\'s possible that an animal is infected and not (yet) producing antibodies. Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland (udder or milk-giving gland) of animals, usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms of mastitis are heat, pain, and swelling of the udder. Usually you will notice some discoloration of the tissue and abnormal milk. The infected udder will change in color from slightly more pink to a bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an infected udder will vary in color, texture, and thickness. The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is a good test for subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate. Laboratory culture or growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine the exact diagnosis. The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat\'s udder before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking with a teat dip. Wash your hands before milking each goat to prevent the spread. The treatment consists of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each. If untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder. _________________________________________________________________ Breeding A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months old the first time she is bred. A pygmy goat should be between 9 and 18 months and a good size for her age. In order for the doe to conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus (\"heat\" or \"season\".) Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail), mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited behavior if she is near a buck. At first, you\'ll probably breed your does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to consider [30]owning your own buck or artificial insemination. A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding season. _________________________________________________________________ Labor The [31]expected due date [new.gif] is 150 days after breeding. A few weeks before delivery, the goat\'s udder will usually become enlarged. A day or two before birth, the udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two. The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of mucous. In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before birth. In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac which is surrounded by a water sac. Usually the water sac bursts 30 minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid. The amniotic sac might burst a few minutes before delivery. Usually, a kid will be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later. [32][Birth.gif] If the kids haven\'t arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks, or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by repositioning the kid or \"pulling\" the kid out. _________________________________________________________________ Care of newborn goats Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and nose are free of mucous. It is not necessary to cut the umbilical cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of the kid, we tie it with dental floss. Within an hour of birth, we dip the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections. Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse. It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins. Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned. Before dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns) and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod is repeated yearly. _________________________________________________________________ Cost of raising a goat Here are the approximate costs of items needed for raising a goat: 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Purchase price: Expect to pay between $100 and $300 for a registered Dairy Goat kid and between $150 and $350 for a Pygmy Goat. 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Feed: The cost of alfalfa hay in Southern California varies between $9 and $12 per bale, depending on the season and the feed store.

14,'~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ eye WEEKLY September 14 1995 Toronto\'s arts newspaper .....free every Thursday ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ REEL LIFE REEL LIFE SEAN PENN, PARTY OF 20 (PLUS TWO GOATS) by LAURA LIND Once again the city is stacked with famous actors. Of course, these people won\'t be attending the film festival like the average Joe. They\'ll waltz from limos, through lineups and into luxury hotels. Reel Life was wondering just how far Toronto\'s service industry will go to show these thespians a good time. Impersonating the personal managers of Uma Thurman, Woody Allen and Sean Penn, Reel Life called some Toronto hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions to find out. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman couldn\'t even get a reservation for a room at the Royal York. (We didn\'t get a chance to ask for a horse hair mattress.) And the SkyDome\'s PR director Howard Starkman said Woody Allen could not play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on the clarinet to open a Jays/Yankees game. But Sean Penn\'s name opened doors very quickly at Bistro 990. This transcript of the phone call tells it all. eye: Hi, I\'m calling on behalf of Sean Penn. I\'m trying to make a dinner reservation for him on the 16th of September for a group of 20 at 9:30 p.m. We\'d like a room that is private. 990: Let me look at my book. He doesn\'t want to sit with the public downstairs? eye: Absolutely not. 990: I could put him upstairs, yeah, I can give him a private room. Is 9:30 after his gala? eye: Yes. 990: I have a second floor so nobody will see you. eye: He\'s very sensitive -- he doesn\'t want any disruption. Especially not photographers. 990: Definitely not. That\'s a policy -- I don\'t get them in there. I\'ll have security guards at the door. eye: We\'d appreciate it if no one outside the immediate staff waiting on Mr. Penn would know that he\'s in the restaurant. 990: No one will know. We\'ll keep that very quiet. Andy Garcia came in today -- nobody knew. eye: He\'d like to screen a few of his outtakes from feature films. We\'ll need a projector and a small screen. 990: I do have a projector and a screen already in that room. eye: In terms of menu... Sean had goat\'s-head soup while filming Casualties Of War in Malaysia. He talks about it all the time. Would you be able to do something along those lines? 990: I\'ll have to talk to the chef. (To the chef) Can you make... Sean Penn would like to have for dinner some goat head soup (sic)? The chef will look it up. We\'ll find out what that is. eye: It\'s got a goat\'s head in it, apparently. 990: It sounds weird... but it could be tasty. eye: Could you slaughter the goat during the salad? 990: Slaughter the goat in the salad? A real goat in the restaurant and slaughter it? eye: Like they do in Japanese restaurants. 990: OK, I have... I have to check what it requires for me to have. To be more specific, you want the actual goat there, or... eye: Two goats. Two goats. It takes one day to cook the goat in the soup. But I think he wants the appearance that the goat that was just slaughtered turns up in the soup. 990: Oh. I see. eye: So you take the goat out, and sacrifice it and then take it away and come out and serve the soup with a goat\'s head in it. Like a cooking show, with one live goat in the dining room and a dead goat in the soup. I think he wanted that drama. 990: Literally pieces of the goat head? eye: Not the goat head that was just slaughtered but the day before. 990: I don\'t think we can do that. eye: So it would have to be pre-made? 990: We would have to look it up. eye: He wanted to do something shocking. He\'s talking to studio heads. Is there any way to have a pi¤ata hung from the ceiling? 990: A real one? eye: Papier-mch. 990: That I can probably get. eye: We\'d like it made in the shape of Madonna and filled with flies. 990: Filled with real flies? Alive? eye: Live flies. 990: A papier-mch pi¤ata made in the shape of Madonna filled with live flies? I don\'t know. This is very confusing. What does he mean, the shape of Madonna? eye: He wants Madonna the actress as opposed to Madonna the Virgin. 990: Madonna the singer in a pi¤ata. Does he want the face of Madonna? eye: The whole body. It doesn\'t matter which era. 990: OK, I\'ll see what we can do. I\'ll see if we can find a local artist to make the pi¤ata. If the soup doesn\'t work we\'ll try something else. Other than that, are there any other requests you have? _________________________________________________________________ Unfortunately, after the goat sacrifice and the Madonna pi¤ata we couldn\'t think of anything more bizarre, except maybe to ask if they had Prince Albert in a can. Anyhow, Bistro 990 phoned back to say that he couldn\'t do the goat sacrifice \"because I have parties afterwards and before.\" -30- ___________________________________ [1][pageturn.gif] [2][film-z.gif] To eye\'s Movie Features archives.

Try the instructions below or click [1]here _________________________________________________________________ The listproc software is similar to the listserv software. It is very easy to master. Your subscription request will be sent to a computer, not to a human being. 1. Send an e-mail message to the subscription address listed (it should be \"listproc@ followed by the listserver address). For example to subscribe to a list located at Washington State University you would type the following: listproc@listproc.wsu.edu 2. You can leave the SUBJECT: line blank. It is ignored by listproc. 3. In the body of your message type the command: SUBSCRIBE followed by the name of the list and your real name (not your e-mail address). For example, if you were John Doe, you would subscribe to a list called GOAT-L by typing the following in the body of your e-mail: SUBSCRIBE GOAT-L John Doe In a short time, often less than a minute, you will receive a confirmation message that you have been accepted. The listproc will give you a password. You will need this if you want to process live requests. 4. To post a message to the group, send an e-mail message to the name of the list followed by the listproc address. For example to ask a question to the GOAT-L list you would send an e-mail note to goat-l@listproc.wsu.edu. Write a subject and body as you would for a normal e-mail message. _________________________________________________________________ Would you like to subscribe to Dairy Goat Journal ?

20,'FERAL GOATS IN AUSTRALIA: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY PREPARED BY JUDITH NEWLAND B.V.Sc., Grad. Dip. LIM 1994 Contact: c/- ANCA Library, ph (06) 250 0205 INTRODUCTION PREFACE The earliest recorded arrival of goats in Australia was with the First Fleet in 1788. Goats are exceptionally hardy animals able to survive and reproduce on poor quality feed and limited water. These very traits that made goats indispensable to the early settlers are the qualities that now make the feral goat an environmental menace. The versatile, easily handled, domesticated goat accompanied the pioneers, the miners and the railway gangs to wide areas of Australia. The goat was a ready source of milk and meat and in some places goats were used for light haulage and racing. An early mohair industry added to introductions in Victoria and Western Australia. As the country developed the settlers turned to cows for milk, and sheep and cattle for meat. The wool industry rapidly supplanted the early mohair industry. Unwanted goats were often set free or escaped to form the basis of today\'s feral herds. This bibliography covers the broad subject of feral goats in Australia. Material listed is from a variety of sources: monographs, journals, conference proceedings, working papers, newspaper reports. It includes history, distribution, control methods, diseases, exploitation for meat, fibre and hides and the environmental impact of feral goats. Research programs on biological behaviour and production potential are included. Newspaper articles report on the emotional response of the general public to feral goats and on the efforts of agricultural extension workers. Through the bibliography the changing attitudes towards feral goats and care for the environment can be traced. During the 1960s the approach to goat control in some areas was by poisoning watering holes with arsenic, whereas the 1990s approach is towards the development of an effective strategic management plan integrated with ecologically sustainable land management. The different attitudes of pastoralists and conservationists are highlighted. The pastoralists despise the goat because it competes for grazing with domestic sheep and cattle while acknowledging that in times of drought they make more money from killing feral goats for the meat trade than from sheep or cattle. The conservationists are concerned with the goat\'s role in destruction of native flora, competition with native fauna and erosion of the land. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in feral goats as a source of cashmere, as the base stock for upgrading Angora flocks, and as a source of meat for the export trade. These developments are all reflected by the material listed in this bibliography. LEVEL This bibliography aims to provide information of use to a variety of groups with varying levels of interest in feral goat control and/or exploitation. It provides references for professional officers working with feral animal control programs, biological behaviour and disease control programs. Material is listed of importance to the pastoral community interested in exploiting feral goats for meat, fibre and weed control. Conservationists are provided with references on environmental impact. LIMITATIONS The bibliography was limited to material published in English about feral goats in Australia. There was no set chronological period covered. Miscellaneous fact sheets published by State Departments of Agriculture, and some Western Australia and South Australian minor magazines containing references to feral goats were not readily available in Canberra and are not included in the bibliography. ARRANGEMENT Arrangement of the bibliography is under broad subject headings to make it relatively easy to find an area of interest. Secondary arrangement is chronological by date of publication. Ascending order of publication emphasises the historical attitudinal changes to feral goats and environmental management. Newspaper and hobby-farmer magazine articles are listed under the one heading. Items giving a general overview on many different aspects of feral goats are listed together.

Invasion of goat camps by naturalised plants is widespread. Changes attributable to goats are discussed in detail. The effects of goats and pigs are compared. Goats occupy a different but overlapping habitats from pigs. A total of 228 was shot in an extermination program. Overall density 0.17/ha varies. Rumen content analysis indicates goats are both selective and individualistic feeders. Naturalized plants are eaten in the same proportion as they occur in the flora.

CAB ABSTRACTS \"Diet of feral goats was recorded by direct observation in a shrub-dominated Eucalyptus populnea woodland in New South Wales on 7 sampling occasions during 2 years. Different nutritional opportunities were provided by the effects of rainfall on 4 contrasting grazing treatments. The goats foraged evenly over the paddocks and encountered most foods with the same frequency as they occurred. With unlimited quantities of forage available the goats spent 63% of their time grazing and only 28% browsing. Most browsing took place in dry conditions when pasture quality was low. When forage was in short supply the goats accepted some shrubs not normally eaten, and these plants died; other woody plants were eaten erratically or not at all. Acacia aneura was the only woody plant which was palatable and resilient to goat browsing. Goats mostly ate the same plant species as sheep and with the same preference, but tended to eat more browse than sheep in dry times. The browse consumed was principally the same as that consumed by sheep, demonstrating sequential competition for dry-season fodder. Goats demonstrated a potential for overgrazing in dry times, indicating that stocking rates must be adjusted at such times to avoid pastures becoming extinct.\" 27. O\'Brien, P. H.

Geographically diverse populations were similar in most behavioural characteristics and their social systems had similar structures. However, post-partum behaviour and mating systems showed both quantitative and qualitative differences between populations. These similarities and differences are discussed in relation to the diverse selection history of feral goats. It is postulated that selective changes occurring during domestication may contribute to the variability observed in post-partum behaviour and mating systems.\" Includes tabled results and bibliography. 28.

M., Blackall, P. J. (1979) \"Feral goats and infectious disease: an abattoir survey\". Australian veterinary journal, 55 (9) Sept 1979, pp. 441-442. Notes that data for numbers, distribution and diseases of feral livestock are almost unknown. States that this poses a threat to attempts to control disease in domestic flocks and herds. Reports on an abattoir survey of the disease status of >2800 feral goats from the Aramac and Charleville-Quilpie areas of Queensland. 30. Anderson, V. M., Nairn, M. E. (1985) \"An abattoir survey of the prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis in feral goats in Western Australia\". Australian veterinary journal, 62 (11) 1985, pp. 385-386. Presents results of a survey of 900 feral goats processed through an export abattoir in Western Australia demonstrating 3.1% of goats had caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) lesions in lymph nodes or organs while 13.7% had positive antibody titres. Survey was conducted to correlate prevalence of CLA in W. A. feral goats with that encountered in surveys in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. Discusses lesions, sites of lesions, bacteria involved, reasons for discrepancy between presence of lesions and positive antibody titres. Notes post mortem inspection did not include head and neck. Refers to reports of high incidence of head and neck lesions in domestic goats. Concludes true prevalence of CLA in feral goats in all states is likely to be higher than reported as routine post mortem inspections have not included lymph nodes of head and neck. Suggests future surveys include examination of entire carcase. 31. Batey, R. G., Speed, C. M., Kobes, C. J. (1986) \"Prevalence and distribution of caseous lymphadenitis in feral goats\". Australian veterinary journal, 63 (2) 1986, pp. 33-36. With prices for feral goats exceeding prices for sheep; goats are no longer seen as vermin but as an important alternative income source for pastoralists in semi-arid and arid areas of Western Australia. This study examines the distribution and prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and considers the significance of feral goats as a potential source of infection for sheep or goats. Results showed that of 2920 feral goats slaughtered at a Perth abattoir in 1984, 7.8% had lesions of CLA. Of the affected goats, 49.3% had head, 46.7% body and 12.3% visceral lesions. Results were compared with previously reported data from sheep and significant differences are discussed. Head lesions were common in goats but absent in sheep; lung lesions were less common in goats than sheep; carcase lesions was similar in both species while multiple lesions were less common in goats than in sheep. 32.

Author\'s summary: \"Caseous lymphadenitis was the most frequently encountered pathological condition in 3,720 feral goats examined during routine meat inspection procedures. Among nine separate consignments of animals the prevalence of infection averaged 7.4% (range 0.3%-18.8%). The majority of lesions were seen in lymph modes draining superficial body areas although many also occurred in internal modes and organs. Corynebacterium ovis was isolated from 25 of 32 lesions submitted for bacteriological examination. Other conditions regularly encountered included pneumonia, cysticercosis, sarcosporidiosis and lice infestation, while myonecrosis, pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, cirrhosis and mite infestation were only occasionally found. A total of 171 serum samples were collected and tested against 17 antigens. Samples from 57.9% and 51.5% showed positive serological reactions to the antigens for sarcosporidiosis and Q fever respectively.\" Includes tabled results, references. 34. Williams, M. L.

CAB ABSTRACTS: \"A scheme developed to encourage landowners to develop goat enterprises has been successful in demonstrating that goats can be used to open up heavily scrub infested rangelands in the Cobar region, and give a reasonable financial return on the investment required in special fencing to confine them. The areas selected were dominated by scrub species acceptable to goats: 2 species in particular, narrow leaved hopbush (Dodonea [Dodonaea] attenuata) and the juvenile form of mulga (Acacia aneura), occur at spacings of 2-5 m, with mulga thickets often occupying large areas. These areas occur widely in shrub invaded poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea)/Acacia woodland across N. and W. New South Wales.

These were compared with measurements made on composite samples drawn from the total fleece of each animal. Samples taken from the hip gave the most accurate estimate of down diameter of fleeces of av. diameter, but midside samples were better over the range of diameters exhibited by these goats. None of the sites was very suitable for estimating the diameter of extreme fibres, or the fibre diameter distribution. The repeatabilities of the various measurements were generally high. Production measurements recorded in 2yr from 20 of these goats show that diameter, yield and weight of down had high repeatabilities, but diameter distribution and length of down were not repeatable over years.\" 53.

Author\'s abstract: \"The density of feral goats in about 234sqkm of arid rangeland used for sheep grazing in South Australia was estimated by means of a mark-resight technique. Marking and subsequent resighting were done at watering points. The Petersen estimate was 4.4 goats per square kilometre; adjustment to allow for non-random behaviour raised this estimate to 5.0/sqkm. Maximum allowable sheep density is 12/sqkm. The goat density we observed imposes an added burden on the vegetation. The densities of red and western grey kangaroos, when added together, approximate that of goats. Rabbits are virtually absent. The long-term effects of the total grazing pressure on the vegetation cannot be predicted in detail but will probably be deleterious.\" Includes tables, graph, figures and bibliography. 73.

However, users should direct all inquires about the contents to authors or originating agencies. DOCN 000000050 NO F-7 TI MILK SECRETION AU G. F. W. Haenlein R. Caccese; U. of Delaware, Newark RV P. E. Meckley; U. of Delaware, Newark DE Anatomy and Physiology Text 1 Growth and Development The mammary glands of goats are specialized cutaneous glands, related to the sebaceous (oil producing glands of skin and hair) and sweat glands. From a physiological viewpoint, they might be classified as accessory reproductive organs, as they are intrinsic to the reproductive function. Mammary glands are present in both sexes. Functional activity in the male is rare, although milk secreting glands have been developed in both virgin does and bucks by repeated gentle massage of the mammary area. Differentiation in growth of mammary glands between the sexes is usually not obvious until puberty. At that time, glandular enlargement occurs in the female. Most of it is in increased amount of connective tissue and fat deposition, but not increased formation of secretory tissue. Estrus periods bring on increases in the development of the secretory and duct tissues, with a recession during the anestrus period. The process of enlargement is minimal however, and the glands will not approach a functional state until the animal becomes pregnant. 2 Growth of lactating tissue is dependent mainly upon two hormones, estrogen from the developing follicles and progesterone from the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is the naturally regressed stage of the follicle after it has ovulated, releasing ova into the oviduct. Estrogen, which is cyclic, stimulates the duct development of the mammary gland. Progesterone is almost continuously secreted during pregnancy, causing secretory tissue development. As the gestation period nears its end, the mammary glands become capable of producing milk. After parturition, the rate of milk secretion increases for some time, reaches a peak, and then gradually declines. A loss of secretory epithelial cells occurs during involution, although some new cells are being formed. The general activity level of the individual cells declines also. At the cessation of milk production, secretory epithelial cells will totally disappear, leaving only myoepithelial cells. The frequent release of oxytocin may slow down the rate of the involution process and some goats may secrete milk for years continuously. 3 Milk secretion during lactation tends to inhibit the normal cycling of the estrus periods, with some temporary suppression of ovulation. With time, there will be a return to normal estrus cycles. Milk production will decline, and the glands will go into involution; although not complete, since the glands increase in size with successive pregnancies. 4 Hormones other than estrogen and progesterone that influence development of mammary glands or lactation originate from the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the brain. 5 The anterior pituitary produces in response to stimulation of the hypothalamus six hormones, which exert either a direct or indirect influence on milk secretion. Somatotropic or growth hormone (STH); follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); luteinizing hormone (LH); prolactin (most intimately associated with initiating and maintaining lactation); thyrotropic hormone (TTH); and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). 6 The posterior pituitary stores two hormones from the hypothalamus both related to lactation. Vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreases the amount of water lost in the urine, retaining it instead for use. Oxytocin is best known for its ability to cause milk \'\'let down\'\' in mammals, although it is also capable of stimulating contractions in other smooth muscles such as the uterus during estrus and parturition, as well as in the urinary bladder and intestine. 7 The pars intermedia of the pituitary secretes the hormone intermedin, which has some effect on water metabolism. 8 In mature goats secretions of FSH stimulate follicular development, which then becomes a source of estrogen. LH, working in the presence of FSH, produces ovulation; and from the corpus luteum progesterone is released. 9 Estrogen by itself generally stimulates duct development of the mammary glands, while estrogen and progesterone together cause lobulo-alveolar growth. In the goat, however, estrogen alone will initiate abnormal development of the mammary, producing dilated alveoli and even milk production in some cases. High levels of estrogen in circulation have a negative effect on feed consumption and milk production in goats. Estrogen and progesterone are required both for the complete development of the mammary system, along with the other pituitary hormones. Large amounts of prolactin are to be used just prior to parturition in response to the higher levels of estrogen and progesterone at this time. Prolactin matures the alveolar cells to a functional condition. STH and thyroxine, also exert an influence on the amount of milk produced. Small injections of estradioltestosterone produce a colostrum-like milk in goats, while large doses produce a watery, clotted milk secretion. 10 The hormone of most interest is oxytocin. It is responsible for milk let-down, causing the myoepithelial cells that surround the alveoli to contract, forcing the milk out into the ducts of the udder. Oxytocin release is initiated in several ways, the most natural being nursing. It will directly stimulate the afferent nerve fibers of the teat, causing the release of the hormone and transportation via the bloodstream to the mammary glands, with subsequent contraction of the myoepithelial cells. This milk let-down reflex can also be initiated by other repetitive occurrences, such as washing the udder, approaching the milking area, the sounds of the milking machine or milk buckets, or even the sight of the milker. 11 The process of milk let-down is subject to interference if the goat should become excited through some disturbance. A release of epinephrine (adrenalin) follows such excitation. Epinephrine causes constriction of the small arteries and capillaries of the udder and may prevent the myoepithelial cells from contracting. Therefore, anything that may cause a disturbance or alarm near milking time should be avoided. 12 After the initial stimulus for let-down, it takes a period of about 20-60 seconds for the response of oxytocin, which influence will last about 5-6 minutes. It is important to milk goats soon after their let-down and not a stimulate more does than can be milked immediately. Due to an inability to completely close off milk ducts, goats in contrast to cows cannot hold back milk flow entirely. 13 Artificial induction of lactation has been accomplished in goats with good results by injections of hexestrol at a daily rate of 0.25 mg. Pellet implantations of estrogen and progesterone have also successfully created udder growth, with final treatment of estrogens to initiate lactation. Art ificial induction of lactation has experimental value, but is not practical for several reasons. Injections must be given over a period of time on a daily basis, or tablet implants must be inserted. The methods are costly, labor intensive, give a low yield of milk, and do not produce income from the sale of the kids. There may also be questions of safety of the milk after using these injections. 14 Milk Composition Milk differs in structure and composition from the blood from which it originates. Milk is composed of protein, fats, sugar and mineral salts. The osmotic pressure of milk is essentially equal to that of blood. The pH at 6.5 is slightly acidic. Milk contains higher levels of sugar, lipids, calcium, phosphorus and potassium than blood, but lower amounts of protein, sodium and chlorine. Proteins also differ, since milk protein is composed primarily of casein, with smaller amounts of albumin, globulins and others. Blood protein, is primarily composed of albumin and globulins. Fat composition differs, as milk lipids are predominantly triglycerides and blood lipids consist of phospholipids and cholesterol. Non-protein nitrogen compounds are also found in milk, such as urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine and ammonia. Some of these are from the blood system, while others are waste products of the mammary gland. 15 Lactose, the milk sugar, is a disaccharide carbohydrate that is unique to the mammary gland. Blood glucose is the primary precursor of lactose, besides propionic acid, while acetate (another VFA) is predominantly used in milk fat synthesis. Butyrate is generally distributed fairly evenly between lactose, casein and fat constituents of the mammary secretion. 16 Milk lipids (fat) consist primarily of triglycerides, although there are small amounts of phospholipids, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, free fatty acids, and monoglycerides. Fat exists in small globules in the freshly secreted milk, averaging under 4 microns in diameter in goats and being smaller than for cow milk. The outer layer of the globule contains phospholipids, cholesterol, protein, and vitamin A and stems from the alveolus. Acetate is the major precursor of milk fat in goats. Goat milk fat does not rise or \'\'cream-line\'\' as easily as cow milk fat since it lacks the coalescing factor besides being of smaller average globule size. Rupturing the milk fat globule membrane can add to off-flavor problems of goat milk. Since milk fat synthesis depends on the supply of acetate from the rumen, any feeding regime, such as high grain feeding which lowers the production of rumen acetate, will also lower the fat content of goat milk. Supplementing the feed ration with more crude fiber sources, such as hay, sunflower seeds, peanuts in their shells, etc. will restore milk fat levels to normal. 17 Most major vitamins are found in goat milk, some in abundance. B-complex vitamins are manufactured by the rumen flora. Vitamin K is synthesized in the rumen and the intestine. Vitamins A, D and C tend to be diet related; expecially vitamin A and the precursor carotenoids. Milk levels of vitamin D are usually increased during commercial milk processing. Vitamin A in goat milk is related to blood levels; and no carotenoids are found in goat milk. 18 Minerals in goat milk consist mostly of calcium, phosphorous, sodium, potassium, chlorine, magnesium and sulfur. Trace amounts of aluminum, boron, bromine, cobalt, copper, fluorine, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, silicon, silver, strontium and zinc are found in milk in less than 1 part per million. 19 Colostrum The first milk after a doe kids is of great significance to the young. This colostrum has a high nutritional value and contains antibodies essential for the survival of the newborn. Goats like other ruminants have a 5-layer placenta through which no antibodies can be transmitted from the dam to the kid in utero. Thus the kids depend on the colostrum as their source of antibodies, providing passive immunity until they are developing their own active immune system. The period in which the immunoglobulins can be absorbed through the kid\'s GI tract lasts 3 to 4 days in goats. Beyond this time, the digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract of the kid will break down the protein structures of the antibodies, rendering them ineffective. The high percentage of these immunoglobulins in colostrum, along with albumin, gives it its thick, sticky consistency. 20 Globulin, having a high proline content, is also important for the formation of hemoglobin in the young kid. Normal milk is much lower in globulin levels, having instead a higher level of casein. The functional importance of casein is that it is the only milk protein forming a curd upon coagulation in the abomasum thereby creating a slower moving food reserve for the young kid. 21 The dry matter content of colostrum is much higher than in normal milk, primarily due to the large amount of proteins, especially albumin and globulins. The vitamin content of colostrum is also higher than normal; the lactose content is low. The colostral content of iron is generally about 15 times greater than in normal milk, while vitamin A and vitamin D levels are about 10 and 3 times those of normal milk. 22 Colostrum or milk bypasses the reticulorumen area because of the formation of the esophogeal groove, thus preventing the milk from laying in the rumen and turning rancid, which would then develop scours. The formation of this groove is in response to the sucking reflex of the young kid. Actual suckling need not occur however, as a kid can drink from a bucket and still bypass the rumen. 23 Milk Production Milk production consists of secretion and excretion. Secretion is the formation of milk from its blood precursors within the alveoli. Excretion is the discharge into the lumen, ducts, cistern, teat and final harvest by the milking person. As the collecting ducts begin to fill with the accumulated excretion of the alveolar cells, they experience difficulty in ridding themselves of milk. When the pressure in the udder rises, the cells and lumina of the alveoli become distended, compressing the small collecting ducts. This prevents a pressure overload on the teat sphincter and any leaking of milk. 24 There is little milk production going on while milking is being done. Udders can extend themselves greatly to hold high volumes of milk. During the first hour after milking, there is no discernible mammary pressure; but a steady, gradual increase in pressure occurs until the time of the next milking. Milk let-down results in a dramatic increase in mammary pressure which will gradually subside, even if no milk is removed. 25 While much has been said about the virtues of milking at equal intervals (2 x 12 hrs or 3 x 8 hrs) in order to keep up good production levels, studies have shown that the drop in goat milk production may be quite small. However, stress and mastitis incidence can be reduced significantly by equal milking intervals or by 3-times milking for very high milkers. 26 Rapid removal of milk after stimulation of letdown is essential for complete milking. There is always some residual milk left in the udder after milking, but it is normally less in goats than in cows. Regular and complete milking is one of the requirements for continuance of lactation. The stimulus of nursing prevents mammary gland regression. The response is due to release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Lack of this hormone hastens mammary involution and drying off of the doe. 27 Stage of Lactation Effects There is a great difference in the composition of milk during the various stages of lactation among does. Management practices such as the length of the dry period, feeding program and general health practices play a significant role in the quality and quantity of milk that is produced during lactation. 28 Colostrum appears to be a waste product from the new development of secretory tissues; and while essential to the kid, is not used for human consumption normally. In some does, during the first few weeks for milk production, there can be evidence of some blood in the milk. This is more common in the heavy producing, first-time freshner and likely the result of rupturing some tiny blood vessels in the udder. Milking the doe 3 or even 4 times a day may alleviate the problem. A lack of calcium may also be involved, and should be supplemented in the diet. Forceful milking is another possibility. 29 The production level of goat milk increases for about 20-30 days after kidding. During this period of lactation, there is an inverse relationship between levels of milk and fat content. The percentage of total fat as well as the composition of milk fat varies. Towards the end of lactation, fat and protein contents rise while milk yields decrease. 30 Calcium and phosphorous levels in milk are high in colostrum, then decrease constantly until near the end, when they rise again. During this period, the overall salt content of milk tends to increase, affecting the taste of milk. Somatic cell numbers are also very high normally in late lactation as well as in colostrum. 31 Persistency of milk secretion throughout lactation can be mathematically expressed by determining the average percentage of decrease in milk for each month, compared to the previous month. Goats, given proper feed and not being rebred, will continue to give milk with a high degree of persistency for a long time. High production on a yearly basis must combine high initial production and good persistency, which is a heritable characteristic. 32 Age Effects Milk volume increases with age up to the fourth or fifth year. After that, the volume decreases with advancing age. The rate at which production decreases is slower than the rate at which it increased to maximum yield. The average milking life of a doe maybe about 12 years. 33 Body Size The relationship of size to milk production provides a misleading picture. Large does are not necessarily more efficient producers. Based on gross energetic efficiency, there is little difference in milk production due to species. Although a goat produces more milk per unit of bodyweight than a cow, the actual net energy efficiency is close. Goats have, however, a relatively high basal metabolic rate and therefore tend to have among the single-purpose dairy breeds a relatively high dairy merit and net efficiency. 34 Estrus It appears that upon coming into estrus, the doe goes through a decrease in milk production. This is only temporary, and is usually compensated for by a brief period of higher than normal production after the estrus cycle. There may also be an increase in the level of fat produced during the estrus period, as is often the case when milk production is lowered. 35 Disease Effects Most diseases, including mastitis reduce milk yields. Fat content will rise due to lower milk production. The solids (and minerals), albumin, globulin and non-protein nitrogen levels will increase, while casein and lactose contents decrease. 36 Dry Period A dry period for the doe is necessary to rebuild her body reserves, especially minerals and to prepare for the period of heavy production in the next lactation. Fattening during the dry period can lead to ketosis or pregnancy toxemia problems. A 60-day dry period is considered normal. Goats without a dry period tend to produce less in the next lactation. 37 Season Effects Temperature, humidity, management practices and feeds tend to vary with seasons, thereby affecting milk and fat production. Does test lower in the summer than in the winter, not necessarily due to drop in milk production. Does which freshen later in the spring or early summer will usually have a higher test average for the year than does freshening at other times. 38 There are many variables that can affect quality and quantity of goat milk. Many may be hard to control. Careful and efficient management with a willingness to learn and try new ideas, is certain to increase productivity of the goats and the quality of their milk. úúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúThe National Dairy Database (1992)úúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúú úúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúNDBGOATTEXT2F7úúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúúú %f TITLE;MILK SECRETION %f COLLECTION;GOAT HANDBOOK %f ORIGIN;United States %f DATE_INCLUDED;June 1992',hot

45,'Mastitis in Dairy Goats _________________________________________________________________ J.K. Shearer & B. Harris, Jr. Mastitis is a general term which refers to inflammation of the mammary gland, regardless of cause. It is characterized by physical, chemical, and usually bacteriological changes in the milk and by pathological changes in the udder. Early recognition and prompt treatment are important for limiting tissue damage and production losses. However, since treatment is often unrewarding, emphasis should be on mastitis control and prevention.

49,'ANGORA GOATS COLLECTION: GOAT HANDBOOK ORIGIN: UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DATE INCLUDED: OCTOBER, 1993 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE DOCUMENT LENGTH IS ABOUT 5 PRINTED PAGES NOT COUNTING IMAGES. A SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURE ALTERNATIVE Angora Goats United States Department of Agriculture Angora goats may be the most efficient fiber producers on Earth. These makers of mohair came from and were named after Ankara (Angora prior to 1930), the Turkish province where they have thrived for centuries. Turkey guarded these goats against exportation until 1849 when seven does and two bucks were imported into the United States. Later, more were imported from Turkey and South Africa, the two principal mohair producers in the 19th century. But now the United States has become one of the two biggest producers (along with South Africa) of mohair - the long, lustrous, wavy hair that goes into fine garments. The other primary fiber from goats is cashmere. (See \"A Small-Scale Agriculture Alternative, Cashmere Goats,\" December 1992). Never the twain should meet! To cross Angora with cashmere goats results in a fiber called cashgora, with very limited uses and characteristics of neither fine fiber. The two goat types differ in temperaments, too. The Angoras are pretty laid back and docile, while cashmere and/or Spanish meat goats are often flighty and high strung. (Incidentally, Angora goats, which do produce mohair, do not produce Angora hair; only rabbis can produce that.) Although Angora goats are somewhat delicate, they grow their fleeces year-round. This puts considerable strain on the animal and probably contributes to their lack of hardiness. About 90 percent of the U.S. mohair clip originates in Texas, but the goats are raised over wide areas of the United States. They adapt well to many conditions, but are particularly suited to the arid Southwester States. Central and southwestern Texas have all the major mohair warehouses. Shear Twice a Year Angora goats are sheared twice a year, before breeding and before kidding. The hair grows about 3/4 of an inch a month, and adult hair should be 4-6 inches long at shearing. Shearing most often follows the method developed by the Mexicans, with the goats lying down with legs tied. Shearing should be done on a clean- swept floor or sheet of plywood. Care should be give to keep mohair clean and free from contaminants-weeds, grass seeds, or urine. Buyers severely discount unclean hair and hair showing second cuts. Fleeces should be bagged separately in 6-foot burlap bags. Not acceptable are polyethylene bags or poly twine. Each bag should show the grower\'s name marked with a permanent-type felt-tip pen, be tagged, and contain only one fleece type clearly marked: Kid, yearling, young adult, adult, buck and stained with spring or fall clip. Special problems, such as burns or coarse, extra long, or short fleece, should also be listed on the goat. Buyers slit the bag\'s side when inspecting before buying; sellers must present a uniform product. An adult goat usually will produce 8-16 pounds of mohair a year. Kid mohair should be 4 inches long, is finer, and may yield 3-5 pounds a year. Mohair fiber diameter ranges from 20 to 40 microns. If kemp fiber (long, straight, hollow and brittle) shows up on any goats, especially along the backbone and thighs, such \"kempy\" animals should be culled, as suggested by the U.S. Mohair Marketing Board. Kemp fiber breaks easily and does not readily accept dye. The U.S. Government has a direct-payment program for mohair producers help maintain a viable industry. The direct payment through the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s (USDA) Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) is based on the difference between the national average market price and a support price. In one recent year, producers received an average of @2.475 for every dollar\'s worth of mohair marketed. Details can be found at ASCS offices in many counties. Selecting Bucks Bucks should be chosen for body conformation and fine hair. Preferred are open-faced bucks not blinded by hair. Bucks should be left with does for 6 weeks. Angora goats are seasonally in estrus. The normal breeding season is from late September into December. The gestation period for goats is usually 150 days, but it can vary several days each way. Kids are usually dropped from late February through April or early May. Twins may account for 40 percent of births, with a much lower percentage being triplets. Fiber Comes First Angora goats have high nutrient requirements and give nutritional advantage to fiber growth at the expense of other demands. Meeting nutritional needs should be the producer\'s main concern. Range forage of browse and forbs, protein supplements, grain and crop residues, and cereal crop pastures can help supply needed nutrients for growth and reproduction. Goats, browsing animals, can be pastured with sheep and cattle; each species prefers different plants. Goats prefer brush, tree leaves, and rough plants. They can improve pasture, clear reforestation areas, control leafy spurge and destroy multiflora roses, red cedars, sand burs, knapweed, hound\'s tongue, Canadian thistle, sagebrush, backbrush, giant ragweed, sunflowers, and many other weeds. When growing plants are not available, Angora goats need supplemental hay and perhaps grain. While gaining at breeding time, young does should weigh at least 55 pounds (sheared weight) and mature does at least 75. Does need extra feed before and after breeding so fetuses can develop hair follicles. During pregnancy and lactation, does need almost 1/2 pound of crude protein daily. Supplement feeding must start as soon as does begin to lose weight and condition. Improved nutrition brings more and better big growthy kids and heavier fleeces. Poor nutrition is the leading cause of abortion and poor mothering. Young or lighter-weight goats are most subject to abortion. Stress from disease, moving long distances, or cold wet weather also cause abortions. Goats should be give adequate nutrition before and after shearing. Angora goats must be able to take shelter from wet and cold; great death loss can occur without shelter for 4 to 6 weeks after shearing. Goats to not carry layers of body fat, unlike sheep. Kidding on the Range Due to lack of labor and facilities, large herds are usually kidded on the range, while many smaller herds use a more intensive confinement system. For open-range kidding, small pastures with shelter, centrally located watering and supplement feeding areas, and bedding spots reduce numbers of lost kids. Angora does and kids should be undisturbed for several weeks, since does may abandon their kids. When goats are moved, pastures should be rechecked for kids. An even more intensive kidding system uses buildings, small individual stalls, heat lamps, and feeder space. This \"system kidding\" can be done earlier in the year but is much more labor intensive and therefore more expensive. But a larger kid crop can be realized with good management. Before kidding, does should be outdoors except in cold or wet weather or at night; this helps keep bedding cleaned and dry and encourages needed exercise. As does kid, they should be moved into stalls and kids\' navels treated with 7 percent iodine. C and D antitoxin should be given. Cold kids will not try to suck and may need a heat lamp. When warm, they will usually suck by themselves but may need help to begin. Angora kids, very sensitive to cold, can die within a short time if too chilled. Immersion in warm water to speed restoration of body temperature and then thorough drying may save severely chilled kids. After identification with matching paint or ear tags, well fed does and kids can be moved to group pens or holding areas. Twins and triplets should not be grouped with singles since stronger kids often rob milk from usually smaller multiple-birth kids. Groups should contain kids of similar age. Parasites Trouble Goats Among goats, major health problems are internal and external parasites, coccidiosis (in kids before and after weaning), and pneumonia. A good health care program includes vaccination for most diseases and should be established between a grower and a veterinarian. Goats\' hooves may need to be trimmed, depending upon walking conditions. Rocky ground may take care of that problem. Goats may need special 4-foot-high fencing to keep them in and predators out. Goats like to go under or through obstacles. Five wire electric fences, with three wires hot and two grounded, make a good system. Woven wire fences may be used with the addition of a 12 inch \"outrigger\" electric wire about 12 inches above ground. Small-mesh fencing also may be used. Horns caught in the fence or the crotch of a tree become life- threatening, not only from predators but also from other goats. While most goats are not aggressive toward humans, they are not always kind to other goats and in seconds can do serious or lethal damage with their horns. A goat raiser may find horns useful-as handles. For safety, both for the handler and for other animals, horns\' sharp points may be clipped, using a bolt cutter or similar device.

53,'[arthur.gif] Arthur\'s Column Of goats and men ... Week ending 20th August 1995. _________________________________________________________________ Firstly, thank you to Gabriel for handling the gruelling task of writing this column for the past three weeks. As you will have noticed, Gabriel is a talented writer who rose to this task with admirable liquidity. His other work can be perused in [1]The Column Nobody Reads... Which brings me to the theme of this week\'s column. What, you may ask, have goats to do with merriment and London. Well, the answer is lies in the former. Last week I was fortunate to be in Liechtenstein for their annual holiday (held appropriately on the birthday of the local prince), and am now able to report on some of the antics that occured. Getting plastered appears to be the principal feature of the day (along with bands, a fair etc.), and yours truly rose to the occasion together with various friends who happened to be there. What started out as an innocent few pints rapidly degenerated into a rather decent party. It is on what happened under the cover of darkness, however, that your columnist must report. There is this field. It has four goats. Not large ones, rather the cute brown type that one stops to pat on one\'s morning run. In fact, one had stopped and patted said goats that very morning. Which lead to the statement sometime later that day ... \"Wonder what the goats will look like in London Mall T Shirts\" (we had a few). Not thinking more about it the day drew to its predictable close and I retired to bed. A little later some of the younger members of the crew appeared at the house. \"Got to come and see the goats!\". You guessed it. Four cute brown goats dressed in T Shirts. This is where the fun started. Sensing the farmer\'s imminent disapproval wifey instructed said crew members to remove said T Shirts. An easy task, you would think, particularly for such experienced goat dressers as these. What they hadn\'t counted on was the arrival of one very large non-cute billy goat who, leaping the electric fence with ease, took control of the paddock, T Shirts, crew members, goats and all. By taking control you can infer \"asserted authority\". Within seconds the team were scrabbling down 30 foot drops where even goats are smart enough not to tread. Battered and bruised they repaired to the house, wondering whether the Billy could negotiate the complex Swiss locks on the front door. On more local issues I went to the Anchor Bankside today for a pint and lunch. I have written about this pub before - singing its praises etc. I now have to rescind everything. There are lots of tables outside where you can sit and enjoy a great view of the Thames, obscured only by the back of a 4 foot banner proclaiming the pub\'s presence to the river. Unfortunately the tables are dirty, and the area is not kept clean. Inside, the queue for lunch at 14.00 was long and very slow. After spending the obligatory 30 minutes waiting to be served by unenthusiastic bar staff the food is virging on the inedible. Its a real shame that a pub with such heritage, clearly on the tourist maps, has become such a poor example of a British pub. Speaking of pubs, on my pub-crawl towards home yesterday afternoon I had the opportunity to stop in at Dogget\'s Coat and Badge on the south side of the Thames just west of Blackfriar\'s bridge.

57,'Vancouver Day Hikes _________________________________________________________________ NORTH VANCOUVER Cypress Park, Grouse Mountain, Mount Seymour and Lynn Canyon provide access to many peaks within minutes of North Vancouver and within half an hour of the rest of the metropolitan population. [3.jpg] On top of Coliseum Mountain, looking westward at the Haynes valley that joins Lynn Canyon and Grouse Mountain trails. The peak on the left is Goat Mountain and the predominant peak on the range in the middle of the photo and just right of the valley is Crown Mountain. Both Goat and Crown mountain are readily accessible from Grouse Mountain. Depending on your level of fitness it can take 3-6 hours to get on Coliseum Peak. The adjacent Mount Burwell is well worth the additional 1-2 hours stroll if you still have some energy and have timed things so you\'ll get back in daylight. _________________________________________________________________ [4.jpg] Located on top of Grouse Mountain is Glen Greensides \"tribute to the forest\" collection. Glen has spent the past few years locating discarded timber that has been lying on the forest floor for decades, and then uses his chainsaw to transform them into these impressive works. How to get on top of Grouse Mountain? Either pay about $15.00 to take the Gondola up in 7 minutes or walk up in about 1-2 hours depending on your level of conditioning. _________________________________________________________________ A young hiker on his way to Goat Mountain. Once on top of Grouse Mountain an individual will find that Goat Mountain is readily accessible. It will be a 1-2 hour walk to the peak depending on your level of fitness.

New! A sketchbook of black wash watercolors from a monthlong trip I took to India in December 1993. [1][India5small.gif] Sketchbook of India Watercolors ____________________________________ Life scenes [2]house Influenced by Edward Hopper, this depicts a beach house after a huge storm along the coast. [3]gate This gate led down into a garden that I never got to go into. [4]horse and two goats I did a series of paintings of the small plastic animals that I\'d grown up with as a child. My motivation for this was wanting to paint animals that cast shadows and not having the mobility to go out to a zoo. [5]goat & sheep \'Chinese Generals\' I painted this at the same time I was taking a course in Chinese Art History and learning about how the Chinese painters used animals and other images drawn from nature to express political parables. The instructor caught my attention with a story about two Chinese generals at the time of the Mongol invasion (c. 1272). One ended up collaborating with the invaders, the other relinquished all his titles and wealth and went up into the mountains to herd goats. A well-known master painter illustrated this with a simple brush drawing of a sheep and a goat, the animals symbolizing the respective spirits of these generals. I painted a lot of bad paintings of sheep and goats before I managed to get this one good one. Whether or not it ended up being anything about Chinese generals is another story.... ____________________________________ Fantasy Images [6]rider This was my Christmas card one year when I was still stubborn enough to try to color cards up for all my friends. [7]street scene The inspiration for this was an Italian hill town, but I think it does suggest stepping into a far off city in a fantastic world. [8]tarot cards This is my King and Queen of Cups. The poses are nicked from the card that symbolizes \'The Lovers\' in the fifteenth century Visconti Tarot deck.

(All incubation should be at room temperature). 2. React the blot with diluted anti-hsp70 gene family antibody ascites for 1 hour. 3. Wash with 5% milk for 10 minutes, then wash with PBS for another 10 minutes (\"Standard Wash\"). 4. React with rabbit anti-rat antibody for 1 hour. (For best results, use anti-heavy and light chain secondary antibodies). 5. Standard Wash. 6. React with goat anti-rabbit for 1 hour. Goat anti-rabbit can be conjugated to peroxidase. 7. Standard Wash. 8. React with chemical substrate if peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit was used, or with iodinated protein A. The procedure listed above is intended only as a guide. The results that you obtain may vary depending on experimental conditions and technique. No warranty or guarantee of performance of the above procedure is made or implied.

What a load of shit! The shittiest tiny little pub I\'ve seen so far in England! Still, I had to get a photo outside it, and that we did! Trying not to laugh too much! ;-) Oh well, I guess there\'s probably hundreds more pubs like it all over the country! Mike hadn\'t seen Pulp Fiction, so we sat down to watch it that night.

70,'Bean Central Aura_x Trust No One Call 1.800.JAVA BEAN to order (trust us) aura_x If you\'ve read this far you are no doubt a coffee person. As such, you are certainly aware of the coffee discovery legend. To review: A few hundred years ago some African goatherders saw their goats cavorting with unusual great enthusiasm. Investigating, the goatherders traced the behavior to the coffee cherries the goats were eating. From this they learned to make a new beverage called kaffe. This is a lame story. Africa has been inhabited for thousands of centuries and just twenty generations ago people discovered coffee? Because for the first time goats decided to eat coffee beans? It\'s hincky! There is strong evidence to suggest that coffee is a new arrival on planet earth. It was brought here to wake people up. Soon after coffee was \"discovered\" coffee houses sprang up in Europe and in no time there was revolution. Freedom was in the air. Or more to the point, in the cup. Experience the original wild coffees from Ethiopia. And you too will wake up. THE X BEANS $9.95 per lb [1]Mail References 1. mailto:jodo@edge.ercnet.com',hot

74,'3A. ESSAY: IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON. I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row. I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru. Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documantaries. When I\'m bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge. I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don\'t perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradice Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for CIA. I sleep only once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I succesfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.',cold
