% Abstract
% 
%    This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings
%    of a single user on these web pages. The web pages are on four
%    seperate subjects (Bands- recording artists; Goats; Sheep; and
%    BioMedical)

% Data Characteristics
% 
%    The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at each web page
%    and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100 pages per
%    domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn user
%    profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
% Data Format
% 
%    Each subject is in a seperate directory. Within each directory, there
%    is an file named "index". The index contains information on the other
%    files. Each entry is a line of the form:
%  file-name  |  rating  |  url  |  date-rated  |  title
% 
%    where file-name is the name of a file (usually an integer), rating is
%    hot, medium, or cold. There are so few medium's that mediums are
%    usually merged with cold in experiments.
% 
%    The other fields aren't used in learning, but they are collected by
%    the interface for other purposes. They are the url of the html source,
%    the date rated and the title of the web oage.

% Problem Description
% 
%    The problem is to predict user ratings for web pages (within a subject
%    category). The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at
%    each web page and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100
%    pages per domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn
%    user profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
%    The accuracy of predicting ratings is reported in early publications.
%    Later publications used the precision at top N or the F-measure.
% 
% Results
% 
%    The initially study compared traditional meachine learning methods
%    with IR methods. A variety of learning algorithms worked acceptably,
%    including naive bayes, nearest neighbor, and Rocchio's method

If you have something to contribute on OSA, in any format, send it along and I\'ll format it and put it up here if I think it is of value. If you have information about other disorders, you can also send that, but it must be pre-formatted (in HTML) and ready to go.

The main focus of the dockers group is the development of tools for the discovery of lead compounds once the 3D structure of a target receptor is known. Our best known tool is the program [1]DOCK, which searches databases of chemical structures for potential lead compounds for a particular receptor. We\'ve also been developing BUILDER, for design of novel compounds to interact with particular receptor, and are experimenting with QSAR applications of DOCK. _________________________________________________________________ [2]DOCK 3.5 is now available! _________________________________________________________________ More information about us 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh The [3]DOCK page 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh [4]New Features in DOCK 3.5 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh BUILDER page 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh List of current [5]references from dockers group 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh [6]Who\'s in the Kuntz Group? _________________________________________________________________ [7]Other UCSF www links _________________________________________________________________ [8]droe@cgl.ucsf.edu (Diana Roe) Tue Feb 21 1995 References 1. http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/kuntz/dock.html 2. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/dockv35.html 3. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/dock.html 4. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/dockv35.html 5. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/refs.html 6. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/kuntz_people.html 7. file://cgl.ucsf.edu/ucsfwebsrvrs.html 8. http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~droe/diana.html',cold

We invite other sites to submit URL\'s on related information for incorporation into our subnet, and we also invite the submission of materials to include. The mission of this site is to provide a reference point for information regarding Dataspace related items, where Dataspace is a dynamic, distributed voxel database. This would include works dealing with the rendering of voxel data, manipulation and simulation of voxel models, and distributed computing algorithms. After you have finished exploring our site, feel free to submit comments using our [8]Comments Form Please use the text-based or image-based navigation scripts at the top of each page to explore our extensive World Wide Web offerings. Update: [9]Vox-L Inc. was one of the first companies to license Lateiner Dataspace\'s volume rendering technologies (the MRI images in the greeting banner were generated using these algorithms). Vox-L\'s Visualizer software has incorporated Lateiner Dataspace technology since 1992. In 1994, Vox-L licensed additional technology, including an embedded version of Dataspace TM (our high-speed volumetric object database) for use in the Vox-L Visualizer (incorporating the database to power Vox-L\'s segmentation and classification tools). In addition, Vox-L recently licensed the Dataspace Object Manager to power the communication between the Vox-L Visualizer and Vox-L Extension processes built using the Vox-L API (see [10]for more information). Vox-L Inc. has stated that their next goal is to license Dataspace simulation technology for incorporation into the Vox-L Visualizer to enable enhanced Virtual Surgery applications. To learn more about Dataspace as a simulation environment and as a distributed metacomputing engine, read [11]Interview with Mathematician about Dataspace. To learn more about licensing technology from Lateiner Dataspace, send mail to [12]info@dataspace.com. _________________________________________________________________ [13]About the Dataspace.com World Wide Web server [14](C) Copyright And Legal Notice [15]JSL References 1. http://www.dataspace.com:84/cgi-bin/imagemap/ld-bar 2. http://www.dataspace.com/ 3. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/papers/Papers.html 4. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/tech/TechReports.html 5. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/documents/ftp.html 6. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/documents/related.html 7. http://www.dataspace.com:84/forms/comments.html 8. http://www.dataspace.com:84/forms/comments.html 9. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/vox-l.html 10. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/vapi/VAPI-Developer.html 11. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/documents/interview.html 12. mailto:info@dataspace.com 13. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/about.html 14. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/copyright.html 15. http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/people/lateiner.html',cold

The primary business focus of RTP is to acquire, develop, and out-license novel pharmaceutical products and technologies that offer significant medical and health care benefits. Among other innovations, the [14]MicroCrystal(TM) drug delivery system for water-insoluble drugs is RTP\'s flagship technology. [15]ToC _________________________________________________________________ MicroCrystal Technology Profile MicroCrystal(TM) technology consists of encapsulation of a water-insoluble pharmaceutical agent in natural or semi-synthetic phospholipids. The final product is a very fine aqueous suspension of submicron-sized (0.3 to 1.0 micron) phospholipid-coated drug -- MicroCrystals. The components used in MicroCrystal technology are biocompatible and are classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized As Safe. Both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms are available. The concept of using phospholipids for drug delivery has intrigued scientists for decades. After years of research, RTP has successfully devised a lipid-based drug delivery system for oral, parenteral, or topical administration of hydrophobic compounds. [16]ToC Advantages of MicroCrystal Technology The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offer many advantages over other drug drug delivery systems. These advantages ranges from payload capacity to marketing exclusivity. RTP is committed to the MicroCrystal drug delivery system. [17]ToC MicroCrystal Technology vs. Liposomes Unlike liposomes, which are primarily meant to entrap water-soluble agents, MicroCrystal formulations are ideal for water-insoluble drugs. 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh MicroCrystal(TM) 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Inner core is hydrophobic 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Lipid chains point inward 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh High payload 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Extended shelf life 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Less expensive to manufacture 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Not retained by the RES Liposomes 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Inner core is hydrophilic 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Phosphate groups point inward 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Relatively low payload capacity 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Limited shelf life 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Relatively expensive to manufacture 20newsgroups.sh CorelFeatures.sh JapaneseVowels.sh Makefile SyskillWebert.sh UNIX_user_data.sh auslan.sh auslan2.sh census-income.sh census1990.sh coil.sh covertype.sh eeg.sh el_nino.sh internet_usage.sh ipums.sh kddcup98.sh kddcup99.sh msweb.sh nsfabs.sh robotfailure.sh synthetic.sh synthetic_control.sh Retained by RES The goal of a drug delivery system is to provide a patient-friendly formulation that is capable of delivering medically relevant amounts of drug. The versatility and reliability of the MicroCrystal technology provide many advantages over formulations that employ organic solvents and detergents to achieve adequate drug payloads. [18]ToC Oral Availability Improvement if oral availability using MicroCrystal technology has been demonstrated in dog and rat models with various drugs that are known to have poor oral availability. For example, MicroCrystal-formulated acyclovir in a cross-over study with sonicated bulk suspensions. In animal models, the bioavailability of acyclovir increased by 76%, and the bioavailablity of cefuroxime increased by 385%. [19]ToC Payload Capacity MicroCrystal technology produces high concentrations (up to 200 mg/mL) of physiologically compatible oral and parenteral formulations. MicroCrystal formulations may be lyophilized for subsequent reconstitution, pressed into tablets, or filled into capsules. [20]ToC Sustained Release Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of MicroCrystal formulations provide a tissue-compatible, sustained release lasting 12 to 96 hours. The slow release pattern results from encapsulation of the raw drug with phospholipids. Additional advantages of MicrCrystal sustained release include consistent blood levels of drug and high tissue compatibility. [21]ToC Immediate Release MicroCrystal technology delivers immediate release of drug through intravenous dosing. The rapid dilution of MicroCrystals improves the binding process of drug to plasma proteins. [22]ToC Toxicity Pilot intravenous toxicity sudies in rats show that the dose-dependent toxicity profiles of MicroCrystal formulations are identical to those seen with drugs that are not formulated using MicroCrystal technology. Additionally, in an acute toxicity study in rabbits (Draize Test), MicroCrystal-formulated drugs failed to produce significant irritation. These results indicate that no additional toxic effects are produced by the components of the MicroCrystal formulations. [23]ToC Marketing Exclusivity Through extensive U.S. and internationally issued and pending patents, MicroCrystal techology offers a patentable drug delivery system. For drugs approaching off-patent status, MicroCrystal technology offers a potential patent-extension strategy. MicroCrystal formulations can be commercially manufactured using currently available equipment and excipients. [24]ToC Conclusion Versatility and reliability are essential elements of successful drug delivery systems.

176-1745777927,'Department of Food Science & Nutrition University of Minnesota [1]Departmental Logo This page last modified Monday, September 11, 1995 11:00:32 Hello cress.ics.uci.edu You are visitor number 6106. (The counter was started on 1 July) _________________________________________________________________ About These Pages. These pages serve a number of functions. First, you will find information about the Department of Food Science & Nutrition at the University of Minnesota. This will aid you in learning something about who we are and what we do. We offer a short [2]photographic tour of FScN if you\'d like to see what \"we\" look like. You can also visit our individual [3]home pages. In a more general sense, we also provide resources related to specific faculty, staff and student interests. We are attempting to provide information relative to aspects of the study of food science and nutrition, in general. This will range from our K12 page (providing links to some of the K12 programs we are involved in) to our Food-Law page (providing information and links to sites relating to food law). Finally, we provide a variety of specific resources to support our students, staff and faculty. This would include materials for specific classes, newsletters and other announcements, and whatever other aids and links we can develop to make our lives more coherent. These pages are continually growing and changing. We are trying to find ways to make our information more obvious and readily useful. We are in the midst of a new metamorphosis. As the pages shift and reshape themselves, I welcome your feedback. Whether you are just web hopping, or a professional food scientist or nutritionist, I invite you to sign our [4][nutrman1.gif] guestbook. [5]Paul Brady, webmeister & nutritionist [6]An audio greeting (479 kb). The Department of Food Science and Nutrition offers [7]undergraduate and [8]graduate programs in Nutrition and in Food Science that prepare students for careers related to food and health. Students graduate from the undergraduate programs with a Bachelor of Science degree. Students may obtain either Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degrees from graduate programs. The studies of nutrition and food science cover the food continuum from the producer to the consumer, including food processing, product development, food distribution and marketing, its preparation and serving, and the nutrition of people as it relates to health, the prevention of chronic diseases and their treatment. The Department of Food Science and Nutrition is jointly administered by the [9]College of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Science (CAFES) and the [10]College of Human Ecology (CHE) and the Food Science Program and the Nutrition Program are open to students registered in either College.

HealthNet to GO! is an exercise to optimize currently available Internet tools for the health community. It consists of a number of different packages which can be easily installed and allow the health Internet user to easily access a number of different health related sites. Important !!! Disclaimer: HealthNet to GO! is NOT a commercial product, is NOT for resale purposes, is NOT supported and we take NO responsiblity for any problems it may cause. It is a reconfiguration of different currently available Internet software to \"point\" to health related content around the Internet. HealthNet to GO! and the related projects with the goal of enabling users to make better use of the content that is currently available to them. It is currently available for Windows 3.1x formats and assumes that the user either has access to SLIP (or SLIP like access - through something like [8]TIA), or a direct connection via a LAN and is thus capable of using Windows 3.1x interfaces to access the Internet. It is hoped that by providing easier installation and preconfigured pointers that new health users on the Internet will be able to start using Internet to be able to assist them in their work. HealthNet to GO is available in a number of formats a) FORMAT1: The full \"plug and play format\" HealthNet to Go! has an easy plug and play install package and should be installed from three 1.44M, 3.5\" Diskettes.

188-2078917053,'Web of Addictions Welcome to the Web of Addictions. [1][5percmdt.gif] The Web of Addictions was recently awarded the \"top 5% award\" by [2]Point Communications for excellence in content, design and presentation The Web of Addictions is dedicated to providing accurate information about alcohol and other drug addictions. We developed the Web of Addictions for several reasons. We are concerned about the pro drug use messages in some Web sites and in some use groups. We are concerned about the appalling extent of misinformation about abused drugs on the internet, particularly on some usenet news groups. Finally, we wanted to provide a resource for teachers, students and others who needed factual information about abused drugs. We take addictions seriously. You won\'t find glib, hip treatment of this very serious topic here.

18-1884751139,'[camisbanner2.gif] _________________________________________________________________ Center Description The Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford was established in 1990 to create links between academic, research, and administrative computing activities in the [1]Stanford University School of Medicine, and to serve as a source of advice to the Deans office on [2]informatics issues. The Center was then funded in 1992 by the [3]National Library of Medicine (NLM) to create a shared computing resource to support research activities in biomedical informatics. This resource is also named CAMIS and supports an active core research program, the computing infrastructure and day-to-day computing needs of a large number of researchers, each of whom has external support from [4]NIH (the National Institutes of Health) or other agencies through grants or contracts. Though the CAMIS resource is [5]Stanford-based, its mission has a national character, which includes support of national electronic mail distribution lists, extensive on-line information resources, an annual CAMIS symposium, three academic training programs, a visiting scholar program and a national advisory council. The nominal location of CAMIS is in the [6]Medical School Office Building (MSOB) on the [7]Stanford University campus. _________________________________________________________________ [8]General Information Includes answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Please read this before sending email to the maintainers of this web. [9]Academic Programs Descriptions of the degree programs in medical informatics and related disciplines at Stanford University. Also includes information about the Informatics Short Course as well as other medical informatics training environments in the United States. [10]Research Groups Information about past and present research groups. [11]Publications Technical report abstracts and PostScript where available. [12]Calendar of Events Announcements of interest to the local CAMIS community including colloquia, symposia, journal club and other meetings. [13]People Profiles of members of the CAMIS community.

In one directory [2]directory I list files that were included in the last mailout. In another [3]directory are files added since then. If you use the links below to grab any file, be aware that you will be getting the version sent in the last mailout, so you just may want to check the [4]new directory to see if there is anything later. The files exist in several different formats: o [5]Annotated Nucleotide sequences in EMBL format. Beware that this is a very large file occupying about 4 Mb at last count. o [6]Annotated Nucleotide sequences in GCG format. Note: this directory contains thousands of files and takes a while to list in your web browser. o [7]Unannotated nucleotide sequences suitable for importation into PC programs o [8]Annotated Protein Sequences in EMBL format o [9]Unannotated protein sequences suitable for importation into PC programs o [10]List of expressed sequence tags of Plasmodial genes These are included in [11]annotnuc.dat but are separately listed here with BLAST search results for each EST. Malaria Genome Information This [12]list tells you about known chromosome markers for the 14 chromosomes of P. falciparum. The list is cross-referenced to the database and the [13]probe list so that you can identify a researcher who can supply you with an appropriate probe Malaria strain information The WHO funds a malaria strain bank that is maintained at the Institute Of Cell And Animal Biology, University Of Edinburgh by [14]Dr. David Walliker. Listed here are the various isolates and cloned lines of malaria that are available by contacting David. o [15]P. falciparum isolates o [16]P.falciparum cloned lines o [17]Mouse malaria strains Availability of Clones and probes This [18]list gives you the name and addresses of researchers who can supply you with nucleic acid probes or cloned sequences. Bibliography of references about malaria antigens Here you will find listings of references about [19]several malaria antigens. I try and keep this current but anyone who wishes to adopt an antigen, please do so. Alignment of malaria antigen sequences Some malaria antigens exist in multiple allelic forms. Here you will find alignments for [20]MSP-1, [21]MSP-2 , [22]AMA-1, [23]Duffy binding proteins and the family of [24]erythrocyte binding antigens. [25] Software tools of utility or interest Malaria Discussion Group This service provides a forum for discussion of any topics related to malaria. Details of how to join the discussion group are available [26]here. Upcoming Conferences of Interest Details of upcoming conferences of special interest to malariologists or parasitologists are available [27]here. Projects and Grants of Interest o [28]Environmental Health Project of USAID Other Malaria and Parasitology Sites This provides pointers to other sites of interest to parasitologists or tropical disease people. o [29]European Community Database of Antigens Used in Malaria Vaccination Experiments o [30]Parasite genome projects home page o [31]World Health Organization Web Site o [32]Centre for Disease Control Publications and Information o [33]The Multimedia Medical Reference Library o [34]Department of Tropical Medicine, Tulane University [35]Acknowledgments ____________________________________________________ Report bugs and comments to [36]ross.coppel@med.monash.edu.au I also welcome any suggestions for additions or new services.

Once subscribed, members are automatically sent E-mail copies of all communications sent to those lists. Generally, one subscribes by sending an E-mail message to the List Server containing the following information in the message area: subscribe LISTNAME your_first_name your_last_name You then will get further instructions that tell you how to post messages to the List Address, unsubscribe, find out who is on the list, and other capabilities. Some of the lists archive their discussions and place them in public directories. If this is done (and we know about it), the message archives can be examined without necessarily signing up as a member. This provides a means to look at the list\'s content and determine whether you are interested or not in becoming a member. If the list contents are archived the YES entry in the Archived? column will be highlighted below and you can click on it to see the archive. The table below summarizes the key information you need to contact each of these lists. Clicking on the List Name jumps to a description of that particular list. To subscribe you must send an E mail message to the List Server, as explained above. If your WEB browser supports \"mail\" and you have your E-mail address handy, you can sign up for any of these lists right now by clicking on its respective List Server in the table below. There is also the capability to [260]search the thousands of public lists by key word for new or related lists. |[261]return to Main index| |[262]Jump to List Table| |[263]Other Internet Resources sub-index| _____________________________________________________________ Injury Control List Servers Table List Name List Server to subscribe Archived? --------- -------------------------- --------- 1 [264]INJURY-L on [265]LISTSERV@WVNVM.WVNET.EDU [266]YES 2 [267]INTVIO-L on [268]LISTSERV@URIACC.URI.EDU 3 [269]EJINTVIO on [270]LISTSERV@URIACC.URI.EDU 4 [271]EHS-INFO on [272]LISTPROC@AEMRC.ARIZONA.EDU [273]YES 5 [274]EMSNY-L on [275]LISTSERV@ALBNYDH@.BITNET 6 [276]BIOMCH-L on [277]LISTSERV@NIC.SURFNET.NL 7 [278]SAFETY on [279]LISTSERV@UVMVM.UVM.EDU 8 [280]TBI-SPRT on [281]LISTSERV@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU [282]YES 9 [283]EPIDEMIO-L on [284]LISTPROC@CC.UMONTREAL.CA 10[285]CPSCINFO-L on [286]LISTPROC@CPSC.GOV 11[287]TRAUMA-LIST on [288]MAJORDOMO@DUQLISTS.DUQ.EDU _____________________________________________________________ |[289]return to Main index| |[290]Other Internet Resources sub-index| _____________________________________________________________ INJURY-L is a list for injury research, epidemiology and prevention maintained by the Center for Rural Emergency Medicine and the Injury Control Center of West Virginia University.

INTVIO-L is devoted to all aspects of family violence. It is maintained by the Family Violence Research Team at the University of Rhode Island. The INTVIO-L list serves as a networking system devoted to all aspects of family violence. While various other lists may explore the topics of child abuse or violence within the family, the intimate violence list is unique in that it serves a wide range of areas that constitute the definition of intimate violence. This list is designed to encompass all areas of interest regarding family violence rather than limiting discussion to one interest. EJINTVIO, the Electronic Journal of Intimate Violence, is published as a list. Topics include physical child abuse, sexual child abuse, child neglect, physical spouse abuse, sexual spouse abuse, psychological abuse, elder abuse, and dating violence, as well as other related topics subscribers may wish to explore. For more information contact Glenn Wolfner, Assistant Director of Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode Island. Send comments and questions to the editors (famviol@uri.acc.edu). EHS-INFO has been created to sponsor and support peer discussions among individuals researching, developing or implementing informatics-related initiatives for prehospital and hospital emergency health services systems or organizations.

If a newsgroup is established you generally have to look at the postings, but you don\'t have to sign up to view the messages. However, you may need newsreader software to take full advantage of newsgroups and you must have access to a Usenet (NNTP) server. Some WWW browsers like NETSCAPE have newsreaders built in but you still need access to a Usenet server. There are thousands of newsgroups. To automatically be sent copies of newsgroup messages related to a particular topic, explore the powerful capabilities of Stanford\'s [302]Netnews Information Filtering Tool (SIFT). SIFT enables users without access to a Usenet server to get filtered newsnet postings.

26-907175364,'[nord.gif] National Organization for Rare Disorders Not so rare \"Our son was misdiagnosed for more than two years. You cannot imagine the nightmare we lived through. The professionals we saw could not identify his illness. We spent huge sums of money searching for an answer. When his disorder was finally diagnosed, we learned that it was so rare, physicians knew little about it. There seems to be no treatment, and very little research giving us hope for his future.\" Although this parent thought her story was unique, millions of Americans with rare disorders have suffered similar agonies. Names of their illnesses may be different, but most have experienced the indignity of searching for help in vain. Rare disorders are \"back of the textbook\" illnesses, unfamiliar to the general public and professionals alike. They can strike people of all ages, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds. Many are genetic; others are acquired through environmental causes. But for most, the cause is still unknown. Thus, even after a family obtains a proper diagnosis, they are too often left with more unanswerable questions.

This project combines both software and database development, seeking to provide alternative views into analyzed data. __________________________________________________________ Additional cDNA Sequence Analysis Projects at the Plant Molecular Informatics Center: Rice, Corn, Pine and Others In addition to the work with Arapidopsis, other cDNA analysis projects have been undertaken by PMIC to transfer [4]sequence analysis tools developed for Arabidopsis to other plants: + The [5]Rice cDNA Project at the Rice Genome Research Program at STAFF Institute in Tsukuba, Japan; + The [6]Corn cDNA Project at the University of Arizona; + The [7]Loblolly Pine cDNA Project at the Institute of Forest Genetics, USDA Pacific Southwest Research Station of the Forest Service; and + A sequencing project for an anonymous client. We are grateful for the cooperation of Carolyn Tolstoshev and Mark Boguski of NCBI\'s dbEST; their assistance and encouragement in this work has been invaluable and appreciated. You may be interested in finding out about having PMIC process your sequences. (UNDER CONSTRUCTION. A link will be put in shortly.)

In part due to the newness of the technique, and in part to respond to demand for detailed information, pre-prints of articles and in-press book chapters, as well as a cookbook of protocols, have been made [15]available. __________________________________________________________ Research Papers The Computational Biology Centers has converted several of its [16]research papers into a format for WWW browsing. __________________________________________________________ [17][book2.gif] The Hidden Layers: A Fluid Molecular Biology Didactic Platform Teaching a course on state of the art molecular biology is challenging as the underlying technologies advance faster than print support media can accomodate. In addition, the essential computational tools are generally ignored as the difficulty of supporting multiple platforms and capacities are virtually insurmountable. This project [18](A Recombinant DNA Technology Course) seeks to remove the barriers by using net-based resources [Mosaic], desktop publishing technologies, client-server computing, device-independent graphics and imaging and an array of computational tools operating on remote servers. __________________________________________________________ Web page creation A set of pages containing [19]information and tips, such as design considerations, for new web authors.

1,'[webstaff.gif] [webstaff.gif] [hospitalwebtitle.gif] Welcome to HospitalWeb, a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web. This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing potential of the World Wide Web. Providing a simple and globally accessible way for patients, medical researchers, and physicians to get information on any hospital in the world is the goal. _________________________________________________________________ This list is of \"main\" webservers (only webservers at hospitals will be listed). Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online (due to the \"grassroots\" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without \"top-level\" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete. If you run or know of a hospital webserver, please [1]send me mail and I will add it immediately! This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital that doesn\'t have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!). _________________________________________________________________ Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List! I\'ve just set up a listserv for HospitalWeb. Topics will be anything to do with hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of hospitals and the Internet. If you want to join in this forum, please send email to [2]hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu with the subject \"help\" for info on how to subscribe. _________________________________________________________________ [line1.gif] Hospitals on the World Wide Web: 1.

Hence, I\'ve started this list on my own, and hope that people will use it as a reference point.

4,'Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death Hello and Welcome! This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for more improvements. My name is [1]Alex Denner (denner@yale.edu) and I am doing research in the prediction of sudden cardiac death at Yale. Also, I would like to hear from anyone who is doing similar work or is interested in the field. (See below.) I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death. This involves analyzing electrocardiograms to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Soon I will put more information about my work here. An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle. The heart is comprised of four chambers. Blood enters the heart into the two atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and right). The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short delay, the ventricular muscles contract. On the electrocardiogram \"waves\" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the ventricular repolarization can be seen. Currently, my work is concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most serious, ventricular fibrillation. Fibrillation is a state of the heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously. During fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart. [2]This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor (It is a postscript file.) I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular fibrillation sometime in the future. One of my favored techniques is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to be distinguished spatially. _________________________________________________________________ To Those Interested in Cardiology/Sudden Cardiac Death/VF: I would like to get together a mailing list or group of people who are interested in issues related to ventricular arrhythmias and/or ECG signal analysis. Email me at denner@yale.edu or use my [3]email reply form.

12,'[asmb.gif] [journal.gif] ASM Journals _________________________________________________________________ The American Society for Microbiology has traditionally produced superior-quality journals covering the entire spectrum of microbiology. These publications maintain the highest standards of excellence, whether for reviews or for basic research articles, and attract authors who are highly respected worldwide. ASM journals are available in both print and on CD-ROM. For 1996 subscriptions, the CD-ROM format is available for Windows and Macintosh. The CD-ROM version is mailed monthly, just like the printed version. The system can display and print both ASCII text and exact page images and allows viewers to perform a variety of full-text searches. Command line languages are English, French, Spanish, and German. At the end of a subscription year, archival CD-ROMs are available for easy storage. Member Subscriptions: ASM members receive member rates on the journal subscriptions and a credit that can apply to the journal(s) of your choice. For information on journal subscription rates for members: [1]Member Journal Subscription Information Nonmember/Institutional Subscriptions: Institutions are eligible for ASM journal subscriptions at the nonmember rate.

MycDB is funded by the WHO and the Fondation Raoul Follereau and is maintained by the Unite de Genetique Moleculaire Bacterienne at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and the Department of Biochemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The latest public release, 3-8, is described [2]here. _________________________________________________________________ MycDB is also available (through the good offices of the Genome Informatics Group at the National Agricultural Library) on the [3]Agricultural Genome Information Server, AGIS, in Beltsville, Maryland, USA. If you are located in the Americas, that site may be faster. The database is described in a paper: Staffan Bergh and Stewart T. Cole MycDB: an integrated mycobacterial database Mol. Microbiol. 5 (1994) 517-534 that we ask you to cite if you publish anything that draws on the database. Getting your own The database manager software and the database itself are both free, and you can install a copy of your own on your home computer. In the [4]Announcement of the latest release there are links to [5]installation instructions and to the files you need to get. There is a also [6]presentation of MycDB that shows some of the features of the X-windows version that you may want to have a look at. If you have problems, or suggestions, or find errors or want to share your data, do not hesitate to contact [7]staffan. Queries NOTE that this is an experimental server!
