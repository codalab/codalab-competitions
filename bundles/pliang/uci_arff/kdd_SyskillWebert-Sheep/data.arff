% Abstract
% 
%    This database contains the HTML source of web pages plus the ratings
%    of a single user on these web pages. The web pages are on four
%    seperate subjects (Bands- recording artists; Goats; Sheep; and
%    BioMedical)

% Data Characteristics
% 
%    The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at each web page
%    and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100 pages per
%    domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn user
%    profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
% Data Format
% 
%    Each subject is in a seperate directory. Within each directory, there
%    is an file named "index". The index contains information on the other
%    files. Each entry is a line of the form:
%  file-name  |  rating  |  url  |  date-rated  |  title
% 
%    where file-name is the name of a file (usually an integer), rating is
%    hot, medium, or cold. There are so few medium's that mediums are
%    usually merged with cold in experiments.
% 
%    The other fields aren't used in learning, but they are collected by
%    the interface for other purposes. They are the url of the html source,
%    the date rated and the title of the web oage.

% Problem Description
% 
%    The problem is to predict user ratings for web pages (within a subject
%    category). The HTML source of a web page is given. Users looked at
%    each web page and inidated on a 3 point scale (hot medium cold) 50-100
%    pages per domain. However, this is realistic because we want to learn
%    user profiles from as few examples as possible so that users have an
%    incentitive to rate pages.
% 
%    The accuracy of predicting ratings is reported in early publications.
%    Later publications used the precision at top N or the F-measure.
% 
% Results
% 
%    The initially study compared traditional meachine learning methods
%    with IR methods. A variety of learning algorithms worked acceptably,
%    including naive bayes, nearest neighbor, and Rocchio's method

2,'[sheep4.jpg] Douglas E. Hogue [sheep4.jpg] [hogue.jpg] Two limitations of sheep production are the reproductive rates of ewes and the seasonality of production. The [1]STAR sheep management system has been developed to help solve these two problems. It is a systematic schedule with 5 lambing periods evenly spaced throughout the year for continuity of production. Each ewe can lamb 5 times in 3 years or 1.67 times a year for increased production. Coupling this increase in lambing frequency with an increased lambing rate, we are now realizing an annual lamb production of about 3 lambs per ewe. The [2]STAR was developed by Brian Magee, Cornell Sheep Farm Manager, and the figure depicts the [3]STAR as we use it.

Uh...those ARE sheep aren\'t they? Shepherd: Yeh. Tourist: Hmm, thought they were. Only, what are they doing up in the trees? Shepherd: A fair question and one that in recent weeks \'as been much on my mind. It\'s my considered opinion that they\'re nestin\'. Tourist: Nesting? Shepherd: Aye. Tourist: Like birds? Shepherd: Exactly. It\'s my belief that these sheep are laborin\' under the misapprehension that they\'re birds. Observe their be\'avior. Take for a start the sheeps\' tendency to \'op about the field on their \'ind legs. Now witness their attmpts to fly from tree to tree. Notice that they do not so much fly as...plummet. Tourist: Yes, but why do they think they\'re birds? Shepherd: Another fair question. One thing is for sure, the sheep is not a creature of the air. They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin\'. Trouble is, sheep are very dim. Once they get an idea in their \'eads, there\'s no shiftin\' it. Tourist: But where did they get the idea? Shepherd: From Harold. He\'s that most dangerous of creatures, a clever sheep. \'e\'s realized that a sheep\'s life consists of standin\' around for a few months and then bein\' eaten. And that\'s a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep. Tourist: Well why don\'t just remove Harold? Shepherd: Because of the enormous commercial possibilities if \'e succeeds. _________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________ References Visible links Hidden links: 1. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/gott_&_blandat_home.html',cold

26,'The Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past [sheep.gif] When the first white men visited Yellowstone in the early nineteenth century, a group of reclusive Shoshone-speaking Indians known as the Sheepeaters inhabited the Plateau. They had neither guns nor horses and lived a stone-age lifestyle, hunting the Rocky Mountain Bighorn sheep for food and clothing. Modern Archeology and Anthropology along with first-hand accounts of trappers and explorers help to tell the story of The Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past. This is a video for people of all ages that reveals the story of prehistoric Indians living in Yellowstone before it became the world\'s first National Park. Vivid illustrations by Delores Dinsmore and authoritative narration by Dr. Les Davis of the Museum of the Rockies bring alive the story of these Native Americans.

34,'[services_ipp_aam_lg444.gif] The Mongolian Felt Tent (1995)Client: Asian Art Museum of San Francisco This frame shows the amount of wool produced annually by the average Mongolian sheep. It is part of an animated information graphic which asks \"How many sheep does it take to produce enough wool to cover a felt tent?\" The answer is probably more than you think. You are invited to download a version of the \"How Many Sheep...\" animation for your own viewing. The [1]Macintosh version (1 megabyte) requires a 68030 or better, a 640 by 480 or larger monitor running at 256 colors. It is a self-unstuffing archive and will unstuff to about 1.6 megabytes on your hard disk. The [2]Windows version (1.3 mebagytes) requires a \'486/33 or better, a 640 by 480 or larger monitor running at 256 colors, and a sound card. It is a PKZIP file and will unzip to about 2 megabytes on your hard disk. You will need to locate a copy of the PKUNZIP.EXE program to unzip the file. _________________________________________________________________ Other examples from this project: [3]Chapter 2, jpeg [4]QuickTime VR, jpeg [5]3D model, jpeg _________________________________________________________________ [6][global_goback.gif] Interactive Publications and Prototype design services.

A few may have some specific insights, and a rare few may have general background, but that is not the general case. For instance, being able to guess someone\'s password doesn\'t mean someone is able to design a cryptographic algorithm to protect passwords; and being able to exploit a race condition doesn\'t mean one knows how to write effective code without them. It\'s also the case that sheepdogs that ever stray and kill a lamb must themselves be put down. Once they\'ve been a sheep killer, there is no way to ever trust them not to do it again -- the temptation might be too much for them on another occasion.

38,'SOP FOR ANTIBODY PRODUCTION SHEEP 1. Sheep have been tested negative via florescent antibody technique for Q-fever by the vendor. Sheep will be retested upon arrival by LAR using elisa technique. 2. No women of childbearing years will work with the sheep. Technicians will be assigned to the sheep which will be housed in the large animal cubicle. The room will remain locked during the day and will be signed with \"Restricted Entry\". 3. Technicians will care for the sheep as the last duty of the day. The use of masks is strongly recommended. Technicians will launder the uniforms each day and wipe shoes with a bleach solution. Technicians should shower prior to leaving the facility. 4. The animals will be housed on raised wire caging. The pens will be hosed down daily by a technician wearing LAR provided uniforms, disposable gloves, shoes that remain at the animal facility. 5. Contaminated surfaces will be disinfected with 1:100 dilution of household chlorine bleach that contains 5.25% hypochlorite. 6. The animals will be fed alfalfa cubes rather than hay to minimize potential contamination. The sheep will be sheared prior to purchase. Male sheep or non pregnant females will be used. 7. Medical Monitoring Procedures: No individual will work with sheep without a current serum reference sample on file, as well as having met all other requirements of the Medical Monitoring Program. 8. A training session to inform the affected LAR staff of the potential hazards of Q-fever and the symptoms most often associated with the illness will be provided. 9. Personnel will be advised to seek medical attention if they develop a [1]febrile illness compatible with that of Q-fever.

39,'PETA Factsheet: Miscellaneous #6 Wool Manufacturing: Shear Pain Many people believe that shearing sheep helps animals who might otherwise be burdened with too much wool. But without human interference, sheep grow just enough wool to protect themselves from temperature extremes. The fleece provides effective insulation against both cold and heat. Until shears were invented in 1000 B.C., the only way to obtain wool was to \"pluck\" sheep during molting seasons. Breeding for continuous growth began after the advent of shears.(1) Death \"Down Under\" With an estimated 148 million sheep, Australia produces eighty percent of all wool used worldwide. Flocks usually consist of thousands of sheep, and individual attention to their needs is virtually impossible. Just weeks after birth, lambs\' ears are punched, their tails are chopped off, and males are castrated without anesthetic. According to Australian Law Reform Chairman, M.D. Kirby, Australian sheep suffer over 50 million operations a year that would constitute cruelty if performed on dogs or cats.(8) Extremely high rates of mortality are considered \"normal\": 20-40 percent of lambs die at birth or before the age of eight weeks from cold or starvation; eight million mature sheep die every year from disease, lack of shelter, and neglect. One million of these die within 30 days of shearing.(6) In Australia, the most commonly raised sheep are Merinos, specifically bred to have wrinkly skin (which means more wool per animal). This unnatural overload of wool causes animals to die of heat exhaustion during hot months, and the wrinkles also collect urine and moisture. Attracted to the moisture, flies lay eggs in the folds of skin, and the hatched maggots can literally eat sheep alive. To prevent \"flystrike,\" Australian ranchers perform a barbarous operation--\"mulesing\"--or carving huge strips of skin off the backs of unanesthetized lambs\' legs. This is done to cause smooth, scarred skin that won\'t harbor fly eggs. Yet the bloody wounds often get flystrike before they heal; and despite the feeling by many that mulesing may kill more sheep than it saves, the mutilation continues.(10) Aging sheep are subjected to \"tooth-grinding,\" an unanesthetized procedure that sheep farmers claim reduces tooth loss and extends the sheep\'s productive life. A battery-operated grinder is used to wear down the teeth. Another method involves using the edge of a disc cutter to cut right through the teeth near the level of the gums. This terrifying and painful procedure exposes the sensitive pulp cavities inside and causes the teeth to bleed profusely.(9) Faced with such vast amounts of death and disease, the rational step would be to reduce the numbers of sheep so as to maintain the existing ones decently. Instead, sheep are forced to bear more lambs by the administration of drugs. Malnourished ewes are taken into laboratories and placed in climate-controlled chambers to determine how much exposure they can withstand before they die.(7) Like other \"commodities,\" animals can fall victim to fluctuations in the economy. In 1990, 10 million Australian sheep were shot and buried in mass graves when they became practically valueless due to a lingering drought and low wool prices. Shear Torture Sheep are sheared each spring, after lambing, just before they would naturally shed their winter coats. Timing is critical: shearing too late means loss of wool. In the rush, an estimated one million Australian sheep die every year of exposure after premature shearing. A closely shorn sheep is, in fact, more sensitive to cold than a naked man since a sheep\'s normal body temperature is about 102 degrees F, much higher than a human\'s.(2) When shearing, speed is everything. Shearers are usually paid by volume, not by hour, which encourages working quickly and carelessly. Says one eyewitness: \"the shearing shed must be one of the worst places in the world for cruelty to animals. I have seen shearers punch sheep with their shears or fists until the sheep\'s noses bled. I have seen sheep with half their faces shorn off.\" Live Export When the sheep age and are no longer effective wool producers, they are transported long distances to slaughterhouses in trucks and trains without food or water. Those who fall are trampled by other frightened animals. On arrival, the dead and dying are piled into heaps. Those with foot rot attempt to drag themselves on their knees.(11) The ultimate cruelty is the live export of seven million sheep every year from Australia to the Middle East, which the Wool Council of Australia supports as \"an important component of the wool and sheep industry.\" These sheep travel vast distances until they reach the feedlots where they are held before being loaded onto ships. Many sheep, ill or wounded from the journey, faced with intensive crowding, disease, and strange food, die in the holding pens. Eighteen percent of sheep die during the 3-6 week transport process; in just one Australian feedlot, 15,000 sheep died from cold in 1983.(12) The surviving sheep--7 million a year--are herded onto huge 14-tier-high ships resembling the old slave-trade ships. Up to 125,000 sheep are packed tightly into each ship, each allocated an area hardly bigger than themselves, so that not all can lie down at once, or reach the feed troughs. Mired in their own waste for three weeks or more, the sheep suffer from sea-sickness, temperature extremes, disease, and injuries. Younger animals or babies born en route are often trampled to death. Shipboard mortality ranges up to 10 percent, and for every sheep who dies, many others become ill and are injured.(13) When the three-week trip to the Middle East is over, the surviving sheep are killed in ritual slaughter (Halal). Since Moslem religious law does not require that the knife be sharpened between kills, sheep often have their throats sawed open with dull knives. According to one witness in the Sitra abbatoir in Bahrain, men would begin slaughtering as soon as a pen was full. The sheep would \"wave their heads in obvious confusion, trying to stand up and call out as the blood gushed from their throats.\"(14) Other sheep are loaded into the trunk of a car for later slaughtering at the buyer\'s home. Wildlife \"Scapegoats\" Sheep aren\'t the only animals who suffer as a result of the wool industry. The Australian government permits the slaughter of approximately 5 million kangaroos a year because it views them as \"pests\" who eat grass ranchers want for their sheep and cows. Ninety percent of kangaroo killers are \"weekend\" hunters, killing by the most expedient methods available: running kangaroos down in trucks, poisoning their water, beating them to death, even impaling them on stakes and meat hooks and skinning them alive. The standard kangaroo hunting technique, as recounted by Paul and Anne Erlich in their book Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species, is to \"spotlight\" them from cars at night. \"The kangaroos would freeze in the light and were shot with rifles. Some were killed immediately, but some hunters purposely just wounded them--sometimes leaving them to suffer for hours or days so that their meat would remain fresh until they could be collected.\" According to Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society of the U.S., joeys, or young kangaroos \"are not considered to be worth the cost of a bullet...and are often killed by being thrown against a tree or car bumper or kicked in the head.\" In the U.S., coyotes, vilified for allegedly preying on sheep and other livestock, are poisoned, shot and burned alive by the hundreds of thousands every year by ranchers and the U.S. government. There are Alternatives There are alternatives to wool clothes and blankets that the many people who are allergic to wool already use, including cotton, cotton flannel, polyester fleece, and other man-made fibers. These wash easily, don\'t shrink, keep their bright colors, cost less, and don\'t contribute to cruelty. References 1.

45,'What Book is [smallblade2.gif] Based on? Blade Runner is loosely based on a [1]Philip K. Dick: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (DADoES). The least one can say about the film adaptation is that it borrowed a number of concepts and characters from the book. Dick also wrote the short story that [2]Total Recall was based on, We Can Remember It For You, Wholesale. A recurring theme in Dick\'s work is the question of personal and human identity. A question explored more in DADoES and Total Recall than in Blade Runner is \"what is reality?\" You are most likely to find DADoES in a second-hand bookstore. It has been re-printed as: Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). The title comes from Alan E. Nourse, who wrote a story called The Bladerunner. [3]William S. Burroughs took the book and wrote Bladerunner (A Movie) in 1979. Rights to the title only (\"in perpetuity\") were sold to [4]Ridley Scott. Similarities between Nourse\'s The Bladerunner and Scott\'s Blade Runner are in name only. Nourse\'s title refers to people who deliver medical instruments to outlaw doctors who can\'t obtain them legally. Scott thought the title made a good codename for Deckard. Some of the \"visuals\" were inspired by a story from [5]Dan O\'Bannon and Moebius ([6] Jean Giraud) called [7]The Long Tomorrow in an issue of the French Wonders of the Universe comic book series. The back of the comic book says (translated from French): This comic-book also contains other famous stories, like \"The Long Tomorrow\", which originally was thought to be a parody, but ended up being more real, than what it was meant to be a parody of: the classic American detective-story. This story was later used as a visual reference for the movie \"Blade Runner.\" Giraud did the costume design for the Walt Disney movie [8]Tron, for which [9]Syd Mead did the mechanical design.

48,'CGS Logo Invitation and Announcement [sheep.gif] Black Sheep Writing Contest Sponsored by the [1]Colorado Genealogical Society. The Colorado Genealogical Society invites you to compete for its Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence. Our purpose is to provide an opportunity for you to apply your writing and documenting skills to \"black sheep\" genealogical subject matter. We seek originality in choice, treatment, and presentation of subject matter as well as the achievement of excellence in writing and documentation. Your choice of subject is important. Black Sheep is defined as \"a person considered undesirable or disgraceful by his family or group.\" Your subject need not be related to your family. All subjects in your paper must have died prior to 1930. Here are some examples of topics: genealogy of the ownership of a bordello which made your city/family/state notorious; a wild and woolly ancestor of yours, of a friend, or of no one you know; an unusual past owner of the house you live in; an introduction to a compilation of the infamous such as to an index of markers in a \"boot hill cemetery\" or a jail (the compilation need not be a part of the entry); a religious heretic, or a devout Christian in a family of heretics. Entries will be judged on such criteria as: originality in choice and treatment of subject matter; writing style (technique and approach in presenting subject); depth of research; evaluation of evidence; quality of source material used to document evidence; and writing mechanics (form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, documentation). The Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence will be presented for overall superior quality in written presentation. In addition, citations for excellence may be awarded for special recognition of originality, writing style, documentation, or technique. _________________________________________________________________ Judges for the 1996 Contest Guest Judge, Helen F.

Sheep, common name for a collection of grazing mammals that may be either wild or domesticated; the domesticated varieties are the most widely distributed kind of domestic animal, found in nearly all countries. Wild species are found in some areas of the world: the bighorn in western North America; Dall sheep in northern Canada and Alaska; the mouflon in Mediterranean countries; the Asian mouflon in western Asia; the urial in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and the argali in eastern Asia. Sheep were probably domesticated about 11,000 years ago in what is now northern Iraq, and they are thought to have descended primarily from the mouflon, although recent evidence suggests that species such as the Asian mouflon contributed to some of the modern breeds. _________________________________________________________________ Send mail to [4]lars@cs.vu.nl References 1. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/sheep.au 2. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/guitar.au 3. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/page2.html 4. mailto:lars@cs.vu.nl',hot

Over 22 million are lambs under one year of age whilst 17 million are breeding ewes. Most sheep are slaughtered as lambs. Whilst sheep appear to have been less affected by intensive farming practices compared with other farm animals their rearing can still involve considerable suffering and welfare problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- Sheep Production Ewes are first mated in their first or second years. Ewes naturally come into heat in autumn or winter and gestation period is about five months meaning lambs are born in spring or summer when the weather is warmer and grass is growing. However this can be altered by controlled breeding with ewes being brought into heat by administering hormones. This means lambs can be born throughout the year providing a constant supply to market. Rams are usually from special breeding farms. A single ram will usually serve 30 to 60 ewes. Artificial insemination is uncommon in sheep though new techniques are being developed to make it more efficient. Ewes generally lamb once per year though selective breeding has meant some can lamb twice per year. Breeding has also encouraged ewes to have twins or triplets rather than a single lamb. If a ewe has only a single lamb the unborn lamb may grow too large to pass through the narrow birth canal, sheep having been bred to be smaller. Many farmers may choose to cut the front legs off the live lamb whilst still in the womb. This is called embryotomy and is carried out to avoid having to pay a vet to perform a caesarean. The practice is widespread and more than 50,000 lambs are believed to be killed in this manner during the lambing season. Around 4 million lambs die each year. Exposure, hypothermia, starvation and disease account for most of these. Sometimes there may be too many lambs in the flock (due to multiple births or the death of ewes.) These orphan lambs may be auctioned at markets at only a few days old. These lambs are especially prone to disease and mortality is high. 35,000 orphan lambs are sent to market during the lambing season. A trend towards intensification means lambs are weaned earlier, fed on milk substitute and feed concentrates and housed indoors. Indoor housing has lead to increasing disease problems including coccidiosis, watery mouth and sheep lice. Male lambs are castrated before three months old. The commonest method is by the application of a tight rubber ring cutting off the blood supply. Castration can occur without anaesthetic in lambs up to three months provided the ring is applied within the first week of life. The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) stated in 1992 that castration by means of a rubber ring causes considerably greater pain than the alternative clamping method which is sometimes used. Acute pain lasts for several hours following application of the ring. Sometimes castration may be performed surgically using a knife. Again, this can be carried out without anaesthetic or a vet being present. Tail docking of lambs may also occur without anaesthetic. Between 15-25% of ewes are culled each year because of lameness, poor health or failing to lamb. These are replaced in the flock. Flock stocking densities are steadily increasing. This is causing environmental problems in upland areas as overgrazing by sheep leads to loss of vegetation and soil erosion. In common with other farm animals, sheep suffer from a wide range of diseases. The commonest is foot-rot which often results in lameness. Foot-rot is encouraged by a high stocking density in housing and pens. Lameness can also be caused by other infectious diseases and is a major welfare problem in sheep. Sheep scab and myiasis (blowfly strike) are distressing and potentially fatal contagious diseases in sheep. These are prevented by sheep dipping. Sheep dipping was made compulsory twice a year in 1985 but made non-compulsory again in 1992. Sheep dips contain toxic organophosphates which are believed to be responsible for a high incidence of severe illness in farmers. The possible toxic effects of sheep dips on the sheep themselves has not been studied. Other diseases affecting sheep include mastitis, toxoplasmosis, liver fluke and scrapie (related to BSE in cattle). Many sheep suffer from pneumonia and hypothermia during the winter when exposed to harsh weather conditions. This is a particular problem for sheep in upland areas. Around 40% of sheep in the UK live in hard upland conditions where winter hand feeding is restricted and shelter minimal. Some sheep are housed indoors during the winter in enclosed sheds or barns. These may be poorly lit with concrete or slatted floors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- Transport & Slaughter Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter. Over 1.3 million sheep and lambs were exported live in 1992 and this figure is predicted to increase to between 2.5 and 3.5 million in 1993. 82% of live sheep are exported to France. Sheep are crammed into lorries so tightly packed that they may be unable to turn around or lie down. They may be exposed to extreme weather conditions. Heatstroke, hypothermia and pneumonia are common. Journeys can last 24 hours or more during which time the sheep are neither fed or watered. This is extremely distressing for the animals and mortality is high. In Britain, most sheep go to slaughter via markets rather than direct from the farm. This can increase the stress animals experience as well as increasing the incidence of injury. Over 19 million sheep were slaughtered in the UK in 1992. Over 90% of these were lambs of varying ages. Sheep are slaughtered by electrical stunning followed by neck-cutting. Stunning may often be ineffective and sheep may regain consciousness during bleeding-out or even before throat-slitting. Stunning by firing a captive bolt into the animals head is regarded as a more effective method but is not often used in British abattoirs due to being more costly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding Mulesing and tooth-grinding of sheep is prohibited in the UK but is widespread elsewhere, especially in Australia and New Zealand. Much of the lamb consumed and wool used in Britain is imported from these countries. Australia is the world\'s leading sheep producer and exporter with a national flock of an estimated 135 million sheep. Mortality is high, at around 8 million sheep per year. Around 100 million sheep suffer from mulesing each year. Mulesing involves the slicing away of folds of skin from beneath the sheep\'s tail which forms a wool-free scar and so prevents blowfly strike (blowflies laying their eggs in the damp wool and the larvae eating into the flesh of the living sheep). This is carried out without anaesthetic and causes severe and prolonged pain. Mulesing is carried out because it is seen as being cheaper and easier than alternatives such as regular shearing of wool. Tooth-grinding of older sheep is also routine. Tooth-grinding is supposed to reduce the number of ewes prematurely culled due to broken teeth. It involves a rotary stone cutting machine to slice off the ewe\'s front teeth through the pulp almost down to the gum. In the UK, tooth-grinding was carried out by a less severe method involving shortening the front teeth with less likelihood of cutting through sensitive tissue. However, this practice is now illegal in the UK. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- Wool Wool production in the UK tends to be a by-product of the meat industry, the wool produced being of low quality. Wool accounts for 5-10% of the total value of a ewe. Most British wool is used for coarse fabrics such as carpets. Wool production in Britain was 72 million kg in 1992. Sheep are first sheared at around 14 months old. Lambs of some breeds may be clipped to provide lambswool. The entire fleece is sheared in one piece. Sheep have been selectively bred to produce a thick fleece and need to be sheared in early summer to prevent heatstroke. Wild sheep do not need to be sheared. Nearly one-third of British wool is from slaughtered sheep (mostly lambs). This is called skin wool. Skins from lambs also provide high value leather. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- [VegSocUK V Symbol] [6]VegSocUK Home Page [Info Symbol] [7]VegSocUK Information Sheets ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- HTML by John Davis [8]john@portsveg.demon.co.uk and [9]Ben Leamy / leamy@uel.ac.uk References 1. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/kdd_SyskillWebert-Sheep.arff.html#intr 2. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/kdd_SyskillWebert-Sheep.arff.html#shee 3. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/kdd_SyskillWebert-Sheep.arff.html#tran 4. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/kdd_SyskillWebert-Sheep.arff.html#mule 5. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/kdd_SyskillWebert-Sheep.arff.html#wool 6. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/info.html 7. file://localhost/research/ml/datasets/uci/raw/output/ucikdd/infoshee.html 8. mailto:john@portsveg.demon.co.uk 9. http://www.uel.ac.uk/pers/1420/',hot

In 1915 here in the hills of what is now Orange County, We killed off the great predator of California that used to roam those valleys, The Grizzley Bear. They are, alas, no more, tho I wouldn\'t want to fend off the bears to do an FMR. I don\'t think the Mountain Lions come down that far into the desert and the Foxes don\'t pose much of a threat to the sheep. The coyotes might be the only predator.

66,'[1]ARRS Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham _________________________________________________________________ From The News, Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995. Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory. _________________________________________________________________ Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port. It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police to limit police escorts for exporters. As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from Cheltenham carrying sheep was halted six miles away near Brighton. The shippers, International Traders Ferries, are believed to have sent the lorry to test the resolve of the police. ITF\'s director Bill Ford was with the lorry as it was pulled over by Chief Inspector Kelly McCartney and the driver warned not to continue. A video cameraman, believed to be with ITF, filmed the incident while a Ministry of Agriculture vet inspected the 176 sheep and passed them fit. A spokesman for the lorry owners, G G Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucs. said the load was bound for Shoreham. He said in Cheltenham \"I will be extremely annoyed if one of my lorries which is roadworthy and fully insured has been stopped on the Queen\'s highway for whatever reason.\" Demonstrators at the port hailed the latest incident in the four-month battle to halt animal shipments to France as a triumph. One said: \"We are absolutely delighted. I have never believed the police were in favour of this kind of thing.\" Sussex Chief Constable Paul Whitehouse announced recently that his officers would only provide escorts for exporters delivering to Shoreham for two days each week. _________________________________________________________________ Contributed by John Davis [2]john@portsveg.demon.co.uk.

69,'U. C. Berkeley Inktomi Research Prototype [1][inklogo.gif] Enter up to 10 words as your query. Inktomi will return the documents that contain those words, ranked by how many of the words each document contains, and by their relative importance. Use \"+berkeley\" to indicate that the word berkeley must be in the document; use \"-berkeley\" to indicate that it must not. Start Search! for words: ______________________________ Return [20 documents.] displaying results with [Text Only......] Just put spaces between the words, don\'t use any numbers or symbols. Words shorter than three letters or very common words, such as is, and, or the, are ignored. The system will remove common endings, such as ing and ed, from your words and search for matches that share the same root. For example, watching will match words like watch, watched, etc. _________________________________________________________________ [2]Home | [3]Search | [4]Add URLs Email: [5]brewer@cs.berkeley.edu, [6]gauthier@cs.berkeley.edu Berkeley\'s Inktomi research is sponsored in part by [7]ARPA; [8]Sun Microsystems donated our equipment.
