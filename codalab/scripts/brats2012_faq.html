<h6>Are semi-automated methods also allowed?</h6>
<p>
	Absolutely. The final ranking will indicate whether or not methods are fully-automated.
</p>
<h6>My method is too slow to analyze dozens of patients in half a day. Can I still participate in the challenge?</h6>
<p>
	Yes. Teams that need more time can still participate and send their results after 1 October 2012 to the organizers. They <b>do</b> need to be on-site and start their computations together with the other participants, though. In the final ranking, such submissions will be indicated as "overtime" submissions.
</p>
<h6>Can I still change my method between the submission of my paper and the actual on-site challenge?</h6>
<p>
	Yes. Participating teams can continue to change/adapt/tweak their methods until the day of the challenge.
</p>
<h6>Since reference segmentations are available for the training data, how will the organizers prevent teams from reporting overly optimistic results in their paper submissions?</h6>
<p>
	We won't. However, the final ranking of the competing algorithms will be based <b>only</b> on their performance on the independent set of test scans that will be made available on-site.
